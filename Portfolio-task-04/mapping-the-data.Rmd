# Mapping the Data

## Heritage Places

Information on places listed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register are available at <https://www.thelist.tas.gov.au/> and can be exported using the 'Export' feature under 'Tools' as shown on Figure 1.

The exported data is emailed, and the files can then be unzipped into the QGIS project folder, and added to a layer of the map. The file added in this case was HeritageRegister.shp.

By filtering the attribute table to records with a location of Kempton, adding labels with a call out, and moving the labels for better readability, the image shown in Figure 2 was created and exported as a Print Layer.

## Georeferencing a Map

A QGIS tutorial on georeferencing was used to overlay a town chart from the Tasmanian State Library showing land grants in Green Ponds / Kempton.

Through a series of trial and error attempts to match the chart to the QGIS OpenStreet base map, the following settings gave the best results:

-   Transformation Type : Projective

-   Target SRS : EPSG:3857 - WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator

-   Selected CRS (the button next to Target SRS) : Unknown datum based upon the Australian National Spheroid

Once the Georeferencing was complete, the transparency of the overlay was set to 30% to allow both the overlay and the underlying base map to be visible. The reulting Print Layout image is shown in Figure 3.
