# Portfolio Task 1 - Data Schema

## Data Set Description

The Tasmanian Land Records (1832-1935) dataset contains over 23,000 records relating to deeds of land grants under General Law.

The Land records dataset contains links to digital objects available at the Tasmanian Names Index held and maintained at Libraries Tasmania.

## Data Sources

The data sources used were:

1.  Land records dataset - <https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-4940b8e0-a2b4-49e6-b658-b124d98e2082/details?q=>

(Note: Original metadata is held at <https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tasmanian-land-records-1832-1972>)

This dataset contains the following fields:

-   DIGITAL_OBJECT - URL_TEXT
-   DIGITAL_OBJECT - URL
-   LAND_DATE
-   RECORD_URL
-   REMARKS
-   LOCATION
-   NAME
-   YEAR
-   DESC_SR

The datset was filtered to select only those records with a LOCATION containing 'Kempton' resulting in 55 records.

2.  The digital objects

The field DIGITAL_OBJECT - URL contains a link to a digitised image in the Tasmanian Archives of the original land grant record. The collection of images relevant to this dataset was downloaded using a Python script and saved in to a sub-directory called '/captured'.

The data in the added fields listed below has been transcribed from the digitised images.

The added fields are:

-   BOUNDARY
-   SUM_POUNDS
-   SUM_SHILLINGS
-   SUM_PENCE
-   DIAGRAM
