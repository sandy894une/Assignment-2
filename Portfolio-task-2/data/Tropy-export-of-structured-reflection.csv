A family standing outside, noted as the Barnes family. appears to be a family photo, taken with the family standing apart from each other on the front verandah/porch. According to the Library website it was taken in 1900. The image is clearly staged from the way the people are standing. A timber cottage with a shingle roof, a brick chimney positioned to the left of the house, verandah roof is corrugated iron. A wooden barrel is next to the chimney. A front door in the centre of the building and a window to the right. Four adults dressed in dark clothing, four small children dressed in light coloured clothing. Two girls are sitting, appear to be holding objects (toys or pets?) A woman and a man are each holding a small child. Three men all with hats, the two on the right appear to be quite relaxed, although facian expressions are hard to judge. Trees in the background do not appear to have foliage. A fence can be seen running behind the house. The eye is drawn to the roof, then the people. The focal point is the house.
