New-town and Glenarchy.—On leaving Hobart- |
town, Mount Wellington being 4 miles to the left, at
the distance of two miles, a small road tarns off on the )
right hand to the lower part of New-town. ‘The first {
house of any note which the traveller meets with is,
on crossing the bridge over the New-town rivulet, ;
Mr. Lepine’s public house, called the Rose. Lower t
down on the rivulet, is Mr. Gatehouse’s brewery, the !
country houses of Messrs. Beamont, Fletcher, Fryett, j
and Hone, and on the opposite side, that of Captain
Bell, as also the residence of the late Mr. Broughton, |
Ou the left, about a mile fromthe road is Roseway
lodge, the present residence of the Colonial Treasurer,
and near itis the King’s male Orphan School, formerly |
Major de Gillhern’s distillery, and subsequently
Messrs. Hume and Peet’s extract of bark Manu- |
factory. Opposite the four mile stone on the right
are the country houses of Messrs. Gellibrand & Bry-
ant. Half amule fartheris O’Brian’s bridge, over
the beautifal little stream called Humphrey’s rivulet,
which separates the districts of Argyle & Glenarchy. .
About a mile in the woods, on the left,is Tolosa, the
property of D.A.C.G. Hall, At the seventh mile stone y
is the Green man,kept by Mr. Bird, & at the eighth is ¥
Abbotsfield, a point of Jand stretching a mile into
the Derwent, towards Mount Direction. A quarter
ofa mile fartheris Roseneath Ferry, on the road to
Launceston, where Mr. Austin keeps an inn, with an 1
excellent garden for the accommodation of visiters. |
Uldbeach.—The ferry is little more than a quarter :
of a mile across. It-has been in contemplation to build
a bridge near this place, in order to obviate the dan- |
ger and delay of crossing sheep & cattle, &c. when
the wind is high, On arriving on the opposite bank |

a road turns off on the right band, through the ro- }
mantic ravine known by the same of the Serpentine
valley, with sandstone rocks overhanging on each
side. It rejoins the main road about the 37th mile, :
and saves above a mile in distance, though not pass- i
able for carriages. At the 32d mile post is the
branch road to the Clyde, described at page —.
Here the road again touches the river Jordan, on the
banks of which is situated the fine farm of Mount p
* Vernon, so called in memory of General Washing-
ton’s estate on the river Potomac, United States. A
very elegant, commedious, well-built cottage has
been erected on it, the residence of Mr. George
Kemp. Near it are the valuable farms of Mr. George :
Espie and Mr. Bent, also on the banks of the Jordan. :
The road then passes through a pastoral district of |
fine thinly wooded downs, principally adapted for
sheep grazing.
Lovely bunks.—We then arrive at the Lovely
banks, 35 miles from town, where there is a good inn
kept by Mr. Guest, and where the traveller is sure to }
find good oats for his horse, About a mile to the :
left of the inn is the sheep walk of Mr. Bisdee. His
sheep are among tle fattest and largest, as well |
asthe best woolled considering the carcass in the
colony, the fleeces: rapidly improving. Mr. bisdee a
is one of the few who bave as yet made good mait |
liquor on their own farms. Ice grows the grain,
waits it, and brews iton the spot. The fortieth mile- f
stone stands on the top of Spring hill, which affords
good grazing ground, but is otherwise uncultivated,
It is part of abigh range of bills stretching across from i
the Jordan towards the east, |

hill-is Dr. Desailly’s, on the right of the road, half a |

rie neighbourhood. On the border of this lacoon Mrs
| Gough and child were lately killed by the blacks.
i Here also Mr. Meredith, of Oyster bay, keeps a nu-
+e merous herd of horned cattle. Proceeding on the
i road about a mile from the inn, we arrive at the
13 beautiful circular plain, called the Fourteen tree
t plain, so named from 14 gum trees growing ina
| | clump in thie centre. Qn theright of this plain, and
ij in sight of the road is the farm of Mr. Pike, the lec-
turer and catechist for the district. Round the outer
| edge of the plain Mr. Gregson has run a plough fur-
. rOW as a racecourse, for which it is admirably adapt-
ed. Halfway between Jericho and Oatlands is Le-

Oat/ands,—at the distance of 52 miles from Ho- tf
harttown. ‘This township is situated on the borders ti
of a fine lagoon, now called Lake Frederick. Tt is i
about four miles round, with a small island in the |
centre, but the water although deep is overgrown
with rushes, giving it the appearance of a verdant
plains On its banks, and near the outlet at the norib- |
ern end is the village of Oatlands. Several cottages E
are already erected, and also an excellent soldiers

Staff Corps, and a church and gaol are in progress, |
Mr. Anstey is the Police Magistrate of this district, Hh
His residence called Anstey Barton is situated about
three miles to the west of the tow nship. Near it are it
the stock farms of Mr. Mackersey, Mr. Weeding, and |
Mr. Salmon. To the east of Oatlands js a branch f
road leading to a large extent of open country called |
the Eastern Marshes and Blue Iiills. The distance
is too great from the market of Hobart town, to ade

York Plains —From Oatlands the traveller has the .
choice of two roads to Launceston, viz. one, the |
new road through St. Peter’s pass, and the other the |
Original road to the right, which we give first. For
two miles beyond the township of Oatlands the road "
is very hilly, this being the dividing range between ‘

an i of the island meet and exchange dispatches, it being
| eonsidered the most convenient and central point.
if ai Twomiules beyond Presnell’s inn the road turns sud-
1] denly to the rigit, down a steep declivity, and the
ia traveller all at once enters on Salt pan plains. Here
is ay he will enjoy one of the most magnificent views which
tf the island affords.. The eye ranges many miles over
1 a beautiful tract of level country, bounded in the dis-
ij | tance, (about 40 miles) by romantic ranges of tower-

Antill’s pond’s, so called by Governor Macquarie in |
memory of Major Antill, of the 48th regiment. On ie
the right is the very extensive grazing farm of Mr, y
Kimberly. Almost in the centre of the plain, and at }
the 65th mile post on the Blackman’s river, is the |
scite of the new township of Tunbridge. Across the ¥,
stream is a bridge or platform of 5 or G arches. For- i
merly the native blacks had been very troublesome in
this neighbourhood, as the traveller will remark by
the melancholy appearance of some graves at the end 4
of the bridge of the unfortunate herdsmen who had |
been murdered by them, The two salt pans which |
give the name to this plain are at the distance of t
about four miles to the east of the township. ‘The (i
larger contains 40 acres, and the smaller and best of %
the two about 20 acres. They are about a mile dis- ,
tant from each other from north to south. In winter
they are filled with rain water. whichis dried up in sum-
mer, when they become covered with a crust of ex-
cellent salt, fit for any culinary purpose, presenting a
surface as white as snow, from a quarter to about |
half an inch thick, Several tons are annually col- |
lected for the use of the neighbourhoed, and when |
summer rains happen to be succeeded by afew days
of hot weather, safliciently powerful to evaporate tne ,
water, the salt is renewed, but the first or spring ga-
thering is always the best. There are besides these ,
several others smaller and of less note scattered in
different parts of the plains. This is one of the finest f
pastoral districts in the colony. Among the chief }
farms is that of Mr. Kermode, named Mona Vale, |
situated in the angle formed by the junction of the |
Blackman and Macquarie rivers,and near the peaked
hill called Grime’s sugar loaf. Near it also, and in +
sight of the road is a curious hill @lled the Don’s {

aigaimst a large body of blacks, in-one of the earlier
; periods of the colony. Adjoining this are the valn-
; able sheep waiks of Mr. M‘ Lachlan and ‘ir. Wilson.
| Good grazing farms extend several miles to the east
i of the salt pans, among which we may enumerate
I those of Mr. Robert Davidson. Mr. James Rob: rtsen,

i i lone y’s sugar loaf, Beyond this the country in that di-
i rection Is wild and stony, consisting of steep iulis
| thickly wooded. Ihe soil of the Salt pan plain 1s
sa} light, being better adapted for grazing than enitiva-
*! if tiun. The grass is impregnated with the salt quality
4 1 of the soil, and has the property of keeping the sheep
t } healthy and fat, free from scab, a disease incidental
sim i} to large flocks in other parts of the island.

Mr. Mulgrave is the Police Magistrate of the district.
There is a Government-honse for the reception of ‘
His Excellency when he visits this part of the island.
The residence of the Commandant ts an elegant cot- !
tage, surrounded with pleasure grounds on a small ;
eminznce overlooking the town. The principal pub- bi
lic buildings are St. John’s Church, the Military Bare |
racks, the Commissariat Stores and the Gaol. There 5
are also many good stores belonging to the different |
merchantsin tows. Vr. Barnes, a resident magts- :
trate, has an extensive brewery adjoining on the I.
west. The town is conveniently situated at the head eg
of the navization of Port Dairemple, standing bee \
- tween the North and South sk rivers, where they y
meet and form the Tamar. The tide flows up to the {
Wharf, and rises about 10 or 12 feet. The water is :

from cowing up to the qiay’ by a bar of }
shailow water, whicli stretches across the North Esk,

land on both sides of the Tamar is barren and profit- | ;
less. From the signal station to George town the soil i
is sandy, and covered with scrub, and that part of the | :
country is consequently almost without an inhabr- +
tant. ; :
George town,—the extreme northern settlement in i |
the island, is 40 miles from Launceston, or 164 from
Hobart town. It is pleasantly situated on the northern
bank of the Tamar, and within four miles of Bass’s ‘
strait, where is the entrance to Port Dalrymple.
This is a military station, with a Captain and detach. i
ment of troops. There is also a female factory where
cvarse woollen clothis spun. Near itis the farm of
Mr. Toseph James, and on the opposite or westesn |
bank in view of the town is that of Captain Townson,
About five miles to the south west of George town, at |
the head of an inict called Western arm, are the re- t
mainsof York town, the firstsettlement that was made a
on this side of the island, though since abandoned, |
with the exception of a very excellent garden which he
the government still keeps in repair. Large trees i
are now to be seen growing from the ruins of the ori-
ginal buildings, George town was once the residence al
of the commandant, but ever since the rémoval of ie
head quarters to Launceston it has rapidly declined. 5
Along the coast of Bass’s strait, about 15 miles to the
east of George town is a considerable stream of water, i
called Piper’s river, the land on the banks of which ib:
is good and pleasantly situated, to tle extent of se-

shrubs and trees, called the Lagoon of Islands. To
the west of the great lake the land is known to be =
most eligible for grazing, as it produces good grass, |
and is well watered by many streams. The country {
stretches out in every direction into large open plains |
watered by various lagoons. The scenery in many
parts is of the most magnificent and interesting kind,
presenting views equal to those afforded by the most NE

EAST BAY NECK. 73
———————OOOO a
rive at the beautiful settlement called the Carlton. |
‘There are several rood farms on the banks of the ri« '
ver belonging to Mr.Maguinneiss and Mr. B.Quinton.
Near the ford at 9 miles from the Lower ferry, and ) ,
ten miles from the mouth of the Carlton, where the A
river becomes fresh, isthe farm of Lieutenant Steele,
the resident magistrate of this district. The Carlton | .
river received its name tmany years ago, from having
been discovered by the boats belonging to a whaling i
ship called by that pame. It has a bar at its en-
trance, Which can only be passed by small coasting :
vessels. Inside of the bar the water becomes deep, yy
and the river is in partshalf a mile in width, present-
ing the most romantic scenery along its banks. Here ri]
are also many rich beds of oyster shells, which are
burned for lime, and brought to Hobart town, These j |
and the large prodace of wheat from this fertile part |
of the country, give employment to numerous small q
vessels. |
East hay Neck.—Two miles beyond the Cariton, in 1.
the direction of East bay neck is Camden Wilderness,
situated in Brecknock bay, belonging to Mr- Thomas ik
Smith. Half a mile farther to the east of this : 7 |
is East bay neck, a narrow isthmus of a quarter ofa }
milein width. Here also is the farm of Mr. George -
Smith. Over this neck boats crossing to Oyster bay |
ave dragged on round blocks of wood by the boat- .
men, Itisthekey to the communication between }
Hobart town and the settlements of Great Swan port, }
‘faria Island and all the eastern coast of Van Die- :
men’sland. East bay neck is 36 miles from Hobart
town by water. Ifa canal ‘could be cut across the ‘
narrow isthmus it would shorten the voyage to Oyster |
bay, and obviate the danger and delay of going round |

. in the calving season. It is remarkable that while
. . the tide is high on the east side it is generally low
| water on the west, and the reverse
| The Sandspit.—Leaving East bay neck, the road
; leads along the northern shore of a large inlet from the
‘ east, which ought properly to be called East bay.
| i The mouth of this inlet is called the First Sand pit,
; being open to the eastern sea. [t would afford shel-
& he, ter to vessels of small burthen only, the entrance be-
[ ing sandy and shallow, and a heavy swell often set-
4 ting in fromthe ocean, From the 2d S indspit a fine
| sandy beach extends along the coast to the north for
i , several miles, upon which a very heavy surf is con-
We stantly rolling, and which, although certain destruc-
.| tion to any boat that approaches it, yet presents a
m3 grand and impressive spectacle to the eye of the tra-
veller. Asmall stream called Bream creek here falls
na] into the sea from the hills on the west. The road
i Pd still winds along the coast, and passing over a steep
{ rocky headland, we arrive at the grazing farm of |
| | Capt. Glover, on the Sandspit river, upwards of 20
" miles from the Carlton. The tract still continues
. along ‘the beach for about 8 miles, whenit reaches
t the mouth of Prosser’s river, and joins the road from
r Brushy plains, described p.71. The country on
% each bank of this river, for nine miles from its mouth,
ih is steep and rocky, and is not yet inbabited.
i . Maria Island.—Opposite to Capt. Glover's farm at
Le the Sandspit river is Maria Island. Halfway acioss
ij the channel is a green islet called Lauchlan’s island.
. Maria island affords scenery of the most romantic and
Ha | picturesque description. Near the centre it is almost
tia divided into two connected by a low sandy isthmas,
1a the sea approaching within a few yards on ench side.

SWAN PORT. 75
rE
Le land on both extremities is lofty, especially at the I}
northern end, where there 1s a remarkable mountain,
with lwo Mumense -rocks projecting one above the 1!
other, called the Bishop and Clerk. The base of this |
mountain 1s washed by the sea, and is entirely com-
posed of petrified shells. Close to it is the penal set- ‘We
tiement called Darlington. A commodious store is
here ereeted, a Commandant’s house, the residence 1}
of Major Lord, J.P, and a fulling mill on the banks iF
of a fine stream of water, which washes the town. 4
Swan Port.— Proceeding from Prosser’s river, .
about three miles the traveller reaches the military i
station at the bead of Spring bay, where a township
1g marked ont, Six miles further is Mr, Gatehouse’s 4
stock hut, at Grindstone bay, opposite to which is the |
targe rock called the White rock, generally covered ,
with seals. Four miles farther on the cvast is the |
farm of Mr. Castle, and four miles beyond is. Little
Swan port, at the head of which is he farm of Lieut.
Hawkins. The litthe Swan port river is a large
stream which takes its rise in the Eastern marshes,
near Oatlands, (see York plains, p. 41.) and for the .
‘ast 15 miles of its course Hows through a very rag 7
ged country not yet settled. The road then winds :
along the northern bank of this inlet, passing the zz
sheep farm of Mr, James Simpson, and a little be- :
yond that of Mr. Buxton. Still pursuing the line of
coast, and keeping a lofty ridge of hills all the way
on the left, approaching in some places close to the .
sea, and rendering the road steep and difficult, the
traveller passes the farm of Mr. Webber, and at about
the distance of 70 wijles from Hobart town, he will
- arrive at Waterloo p oint, a military station, and the i
residence of a magistrate. The scenery which pre- 1
sents itself to the eye of the spectator at this point, |

looking towards the Schouten’s islands, is singular
| and striking. This bay isa favourite resort of
| | whalersin the season, their principal station being
) | Hazard’s or Refuge island, on the eastern side. A
| Jong sandy beach stretches for eight miles on the
northern side of this bay, and at its eastern end isa
shallow entrance to the Great Swan port river. A
M eye mile beyond | the military station, after crossing a
{ small stream, is the farm and residence of Mr. Mete-
oa dith. This gentleman was the first who settled in
5 this district, and has made very laudable exertions to
t promote the whale fishery. To the north of Mr.
ie Meredith. and sitnated upon the Swan port river, or
M4 | its tributary streams, are the farms of Mr. Hart, Mr,
an Amos, Mr. King, and Mr. Lyne. From Waterloo

Te a sandy soil passing several smal! farms, until it ar-
1 rives at the Glebe land, belonging to the Chaplain at
, Hobart town. Between this road and the beach is
( a long narrow lagoon of fresh water, situated at the
ij westend of which on a projecting point into the
‘4 Derwent,is the farm of Mr.R.L.Murray. Also fronting
iB) the Derwent two miles lower down, is the thriv-
4 , . ing 4nd conspicuous farm of Mr. Charles Hippesly

MUDDY PLAINS. 77
a a ee (ay
Stanfield deserve to be particularly mentioned. In :
the centre of this district is a respectable inn kept by }
Mr. Hance. Leaving Mr. Stanfield’s the road passes 4
along a narrow neck of land, dividing Ralph’s bay |
from Frederick Henry bay. Small boats are often i |
carried across this neck, in order to avoid the danger :
and delay of going round by Betsy’s island to Piit- | .
water, . |
Muddy plains.—Having crossed this neck the tra- :
veller enters Muddy plains. The first farm he meets j
with is that of Mr. R. Mather. Three miles to the }
south of this is a populous settlement of numerous i
small farms, surrounding a large inlet of salt water, it
called the Pipe clay lagoon. Among others we may |
mention the farms of Mrs. Macauley, Mr. Evans, and
Mr. Germain, A road also conductsacross to Kalph’s |
bay, onthe side of which are the farms of Mr. Mor- |
timer and Mr. Dixon, and on the southern extremity .
of the peninsula near a beautiful lake of fresh water,
the farm of Mr. Barnes. South arm, on the west side
of Ralph’s bay, is the property of Mr. Gellibrand, :
This bay is celebrated for its fine oysters, which
chiefly supply the market at Hobart town. His house ;
is pleasantly situated on the north point of the arm, |
and the grounds are well laid out. To ibe south of im
this peninsula and opposite to the farm of Mr. .
Barnes, is Betsy’s island, belonging to Mr. King, who |
has it now completely stocked with silver hatred rab- |
bits, so valuable for their skins as an export to China
where they fetch a very high price. |
