situated on the right or left bank of the Jordan, in 1g
the parish of Beaufort. Below this about two | mM,
miles, the river Jordan takes its course between |
two steep hills, and enters the narrow but remar- ,
kably fertile valley, known by the name of the
“Hunting Ground.” Near it, are the valuable ,
farms of Mr. George Espie, and Mr. Bent, also i!
on the banks ofthe Jordan. ‘The road then passes
through a pastoral district of fine thinly wooded |
downs, principally adapted for sheep grazing. To
the eastward of the road, isthe farm of Mr.Cobb ,
of Sydney, and Mr. Curr of Cape Grim owns the
Jaud on each side of the road after passing Mr.
Bent's farm.
LoveLy BANKs.-—We then arrive at the Lovely ,
banks, 26 miles fromtown, where there is a good inz
kept by Mr, Guest, and where the traveller 1s sure
to find good oats for bis horse. Lovely banks is in
Winterton parish, which 1s divided from Somerset
by the main road, Abouta mile to the jeft of the
inn is the sheep-walk of Mr. Bisdee. His sheep are | ‘
among the fattest and largest, as well as the best Y,
woolled, considering the carcass in the colony, the (
fleeces rapidly improving. Mr. Bisdee is one of the
few who have as yet made good malt liquoar on their ,
own farms. He grows the grain, malts it, and brews
iton the spot. The fortieth mife-stone stands on
the top of Spring hill, which affords good grezing
ground, but is otherwise uncultivated. It is part of |
a high range of hills stretching across from the Jordan ,
towards the east.

of this distriet is adiwirably adapted to the growth o? | 4
fine wool, Thefarms on the banks of tie Macquarie ) | ee
and Elizabeth rivers, are covered with a very sweet | 4
though in some places scanty, herbage. The svil is ) ie
dry, but not arid, the heaviest rains passing through Be y,
the substratum, whichis usyalls gravelly. The marsh | | ;
lands are as rich as any in the sobn try but irom the |
absence of the stiff clay, which elsewhere much | 4
abounds, are fur more easi'y worked, being on the i
contrary light, and friable from the large quantity of |
sand contained in them. She p husbandry has been i
much attended to in this Quarter, and the Hobart- 4
town butchers have lon prized the lac \varie wee |
thers, A great portion of the land has already been 4
reduced ander the plough, and the exertions of Mr. ,
John Macleod, and some others, satisfactorily show . .
how profitably the “improved agriculture” may be |
Introduced into Van Diemen’sland. That gentleman .

derable success, and hie, and Dr. Turobull, were the 2
first to cultivate turaips on a large scale. Dr. Pear.
son has shewn what can be done with mangel warze},

equal to those of grain. The country near the Mac-

fine pasture for cattle, and were it protected from |) ae
the effects of sudden floods, would be well suited tt
for cultivation. The road here winds round the ()) ae
base of a steep hill, called Vinegar hill. Three : | i
miles farther, is the scite of the mtended town of ) | ie
Fingal, A mile beyond this, a distance of 113 ‘|
miles from Hobart-town, is the extensive grazing | ee
farm and residence of Mr. Talbot, at the junction q
of the Break o’Day river with St. Pauls. We | :
cannot refrain from mentioning here, the laudable ;
exertions of both Mr. James Grant and Mr. Talbot | iy
in the improvementofwool, each sending large quan-
tities annually of their own growth to the London
market, of such a quality as to command very OG
remunerating, and notwithstanding the late de- \
pression increasing prices. Above this, the | ;
country ischiefly occupied as grazing land, by |
Mr. Kimberley and Mr. Stanfield. On each side
of Mr. Talbot’s, there is a fine tract of country; f
that to the north, on the banks of the South Esk, | |
extends for several miles, and that to the east is :
also a fine tract of grazing land, called Break o” /
Day plains, and extends for many miles on each ;
bank of the Break o’Day river, (a fine stream of | .
water) until it reaches within 10 miles of the
eastern sea, from which it is divided bya lofty »
range of hills, near Saint Patrick’s head.
About eight miles from Mr, Talbot.s, con- :
tinuing along the banks of the same stream, fal
the traveller passes the farms of Mr. Legge, Mr. |)
Stubbs, and Mr. Betts, which being but lately granted | .
have‘as yet undergone but little improvement, This ter- (i |
minates the part of the country known as the Break 1 | 7
o’ Day plains. The landin general lies upwards of | |
1000 feet above the level of the sea.

Ny Tue Mersey.—From the Circular plain to the
he Mersey, a distance of eight miles, the road is
| very hilly and steep, One hill in particular,
ma | called the Red hill, is so steep thatit required
| considerable dexterity to manage a team of oxen
§ with a heavy load down the declivity. Mr. Bon-
ney however, whose team had been hired for the
use of the party, conducted them down with great
iy care and safety. The travellers had reached the
, bottom of the hill, and it really was deserving of
ys commemoration to look upand see the fine atti-
te tudes of the animals, and their full and perfect
obedience to the voice of their driver, but espe-
vt cially that Mr. Bonney, contrary toall bullock
i drivers we have yetseenin this island, neither
nt swore, beat nor illused his oxen, but simply called
nny them by their names as he wished them to go.
, On arriving at the banks of the Mersey, which is
Wi | a very considerable stream flowing from jhe moun-
| tains, che road crosses it by an indifferent ford
ih witha hard stony bottom. The water was about
So two feet deep, and about 200 broad. Had the
ie | company’s Surveyors gone a little higher up, a
| better ford might have been found, but they were
te no doubt induced to make it here, in order to ar-
“hi rive at a small plain of good grass on the opposite
te bank, containing about 6 acres. A large lime
sh stope rock runs across the rivera little below
hy the ford. ‘The limestone country however ends
sh) here, extending from the Moleside to the Mersey,
| a distance of about thirteen miles, The party
Ni | stopped here to breakfast, and baited their horses
ct on the rich grass growing on the plain. It was

over therugged and precipitous country beyond, , :
but it was done with immense labour, and in lz
places by pulling the cartsup steep acclivities ; ;
with the help of pulleys fastened to trees. The | er
borders of this small plain are composed of : , | ie
thickly grown timber, of a very large size. One ;
small tree among the rest was measured by means | | ;
of a pocket sextant, which was found 205 feet | :

passing down in a similar zig-zag or traverse
direction, ‘The river Forth was in front of the
on | travellers, but was invisible both on account of
: the thiek and lofty timber which clothed its banks,

. from the Mersey to the Forth across this moun-
tainous ridge, is about nine miles,

its rise a little more tothe west. Flowing,as it does,
from the mountains, in the bottom of a deep ravine,

: pid in the extreme. There is no good land on either
{ of its banks, as faras is yet known. ‘Immediately on

of the Mersey, the traveller commences to ascend a

above the level of the sea. The sky was beautifully ;
clear, and the moon, well advanced in her second , ;
quarter, aflorded so good alight as to enable some )
of the party to write their notes of the journey. A | ‘
large fire was lighted as usual, before which, some of ) ,
the travellers rather imprudently reposed in their ,

tent afforded, so that towards morning they were }
almost congealed by the dense fog which fell in this |
lofty region. | ) .

nearly on a level through a thinly wooded tract for
about 4 miles, when itenters an open country ex- .
tending over mavy thousand acres, called Middle- .
sex plains, All along the road the travellers were
constantly meeting with kangaroos, which bounded re ;
from them as they passed along. These plains, besides fay ;
being watered by numerous small rivalets, have a con- :
siderable stream running through their centre to- a

ked appearance of a lofty and level range of country
. i some miles to the south, covered with a species of
. short heath, with solitary little bushes to hx the eye
| ) within two or three miles of each other. ‘Towering

| ance of chimuey sweepers dancing on May day, from
| which the hill was named, The northern extremity
i of the same range is called the Black bluff mountain,
6 or 7 miles distantfrom the other. These two hills
My are connected by aridge of high land thinly wooded
tit with low trees, and covered with a small shrab called
the lemon plant, In ascending this ridge, which is
a very steep, the fatigue of the traveller is agreeably
it relieved by the refreshing odour. of these aromatic
ot | shrubs. The flower consists of only two small peach-
AN coloured petals, and at that season ihe plant, which
cs is here very abundant, 1s in full bloom. Where the
m4) road crosses the top of the ridge, stands a cunous
: block of granite. Near it the traveller has a most
a | extensive view to the north-west, extending over the
a | whole of the Surry hills, The only mountains which
pi) | bound this immense tract of level country to the eye
| are St, Valentine’s peak to the north, and Mouat
PRR Cleveland to the west. The whole expanse pre-
my sents a level surface of trees over the summits

i towards the north-west, perhaps the most exten-
wh sive tract of level country in the island. The
mm | retrospect also, from this commanding point,
im | which the vale of Beivoir and the country to the

Ay veller’s turning round to contemplate. It was

the feet reached the solid part below. After passing fe
a thick forest of nyrtle trees, through which the com- . }

on all sides except the south, by thiek and lofty tim-

THE NORTH COAST. 78 .
January, the party set out on their return along the (1) 7
coast to the east. Having crossed the mouth of the :
river Ema with the help of a boat, and swimming the | ,
horses two ata time, the travellers passed by a very Pasa :
rugged path or promontory called Round hill point, | | ve
being the east head of Emu bay, At four miles be i
they had again to cross a small river called the oieen 4
Blyth, in a similar manner. This river takes its | | ae
rise near the Dial mountains, aboat 15 miles inland, |) ae
so called because they resemble in shape the gnomon | nt
of a sun dial. From this to the Leven, a distance of ;
11 miles, there is neither road nor tract and travelling | i
was very indifferent. In parts the brashwood was /
sd high and so thick, that the horses could with dif- , :
ficulty sqneeze their way through it. The party were it
therefore obliged to march in file, and to keep in | ey
sight, In order not to lose ca@h other by the way.
They arrived on the banks of the Leven at 7 in the Aut
evening, and pitched their.tent for the night. ;
By sunrise next morning the horses and baggage ah
were in the act of crossing the river, and four miles |
beyonc the party arrived at the Ferth, which was |
swum in like menner, the boat attending along the
coast and entering the mouths of the rivers al] the | ;
way. A distance of six miles over a*very ragged ne
road leads from this to the Don, two miles beyond .
Which is the Mersey. The party arrived on its banks ;
at 2 o’clock, but the tide was Tunping out so strong ;
that the horses could not be crossed until near six. | ,
The mouth of the river forms a ierge inlet, and isa . :
commodious harboar forsmall vessels, It is knowa :
by the name of port Frederick. ‘Chis Was the sixth |
and last river which tbe horses had to swim during :
these two days. During the time that the PALLY 7. “ly |

point the William Hanvington, a vessel which had
just arrived from England with improved sheep for
the Company, was seen beautifully sailing along the
| coast, and making for port Dalrymple.
wi! | Havingcrossed the Mersey the party proceeded
ae along the coast for about four miles, until they ar-
e | rived ata low point ef land, from whieh a horse shoe
|S reef projects into the sea. The broad sandy beach
t | continues all along the shore as before, but inter-
mixed here and there with patches of flat shingle
. , stones and pebbles. The party took up their quar-
ters here for the night. A Jong narrow lagoon oi
) fresh water stretches parallel to the coast for about
, 4 miles, and the grass ail round is rich and luxpsiant,
Be and afforded excellent refreshment to the horses
ail after their late fatigue. Some elegant aqavatic plants,
new to the travellers, were seen growing ia the la-
| coon emong the rushes, - There is some good soi!
a | omits banks, round which the land in general is low,
ae || with the exception of a small peaked hill clear of
; ‘| trees, aflording good pasturage. A native species ot
; 5 i lacerne, which grows in various spots along the
; coast, is found here in great abuncance.

K whicon is the only stream of any consequence which mi
falls into\it. The country for about 20 mi'es is hilly | as
and rugged, and the Rubicon winds its way in a cir- | it
cultous manner, as it is here and there diverted from mt ;
its course by the bills. The party after proceeding | Oe
about 8 miles up its banks rested for the night ata mo 2
place called Armstrong’s ford. Some time ago the if i
Cempany had marked the trees along a line of read | ee
here, in order to carry provisions ‘to be shipped for ne
Circular head. But this course has since been aban- it
doned, and the marks to direct the traveller are near- ;
ly effaced. The Rubicon though a small stream m (
summer, must be subject to great floods in winter, ,
the marks of which may be seen high among the 4
branches of the trees. This is caused by its taking iy
its rise mear a flat country, where a considerable :
quantity of water is collected in the rainy season. j
The following morning, the 23d of January, the ‘
travellers continued along the course of the Rubi- Git
con. During theearly part of the day the road ;
was very rough and hilly, in the afternoon bow-
ever their fatigue was compensated by passing (
through a fine tract of fertile level land stretching ,
along the banks of the river called the Avenne | i
plains, It is as yet unlocated and was at that time ;
covered with herds of wild cattle roaming in a!! | :
directions.
A tract of open forest land then intervenes for }
about 2 er 3 miles, when the traveller again emer- | :
ges on a fine range of pastoral country called the i
Whiteford Hills, stretching over a distanee of up- |
wards of 5 miles each way. At the southern ex- | |
itremity of this fine country and not far from the :
sourceof the Rubicon, the party halted for the |
bight near a stock-keeper’s hut. “This was at the )

along a narrow valley by the side of the Jordan fur ,
about four miles, passing over a steep part of the :

road diverges from the river, bending to the west 3

al small farms higher up the Jordan towards the {
north, belonging to Mr. Brodribb ; Mr. Fryett, :

As the country farther to the west is as yet nearly

our narrative by the following :—
RECOLLECTIONS, |)
Of @ short excursion to Lake Echo in March, 1823. i
It is always advisable if you are going to undertake
a journey (or indeed any thing else, unless you want | :
to kill time and your health both by lying in bed) to .
getup early in the morning. Our little party was
therefore ready to start by day break, My friend who ! }
was to accompany me, and who had pitched his tent ;
on the other side of the Shannon, liad just crossed | i
with his servant. Crossing a river indeed is not such
a light matter in new countries, as my friends in old ‘
England may suppose, who are furnished with brid- .
S€8, punts, or steam boats of all sizes, characters and
dimensions to cross every inequality of surface that :
presents itself. There is not to this day any bridge ‘
across the Shannon, and the river is in most seasons My
too deep and rapid to allow of wading through it with |
safety on foot. My intended fellow traveller there- | ;
fore mounted his horse and rode through, but the |
animal, thoagh very docile, would not be imme diately . .
taught to return of itself for the servant, my friend ; ,
was therefore obliged toride back and take his hide ii} :

meal of an emperor, that is if that emperor has had 1 ae
the good fortune to have visited the further side of the | oa

Thus equipped, and having relieved my corner cup- Te :
board of some of its breakfast contents, (for though a | f
settler of only two months, I had already my cat and ]
my corner cupboaid ) we started on our journey. In 4
all cases of pleasure it is prudent to have some excuse
of business to intermix, Pleasure indeed is a young
lady most prolific of excuses. In the present instance
however my excuse was very strong. I had purchas- ;
ed four noble oxen of the excellent breed of the late fc
Mr. David Rose, and the beasts told me as plain as ‘
they could speak, that they would be my trae and
faithful servants until death, (there is something very ‘
expressive in a bullock’s face if you look narrowly at ay
it,) and they had actually carried me and mine in .
Safety allthe way from Hobarttown. They had gra- |
zed beside me only two days whena troop of wild
cattle, worse than Spanish marauders, or the plunder- :
ing Caffres, came athwart me and canied them off. . I
The hope of finding them was therefore an object with
me in my present journey. It did not indeed imme-
diately occur to me, that if I should be so fortunate :
as tu come upon them grazing in some rich spot, their
wild companions, at the very first glance of my eye, | -
would again gallop off with them, and I had no more
chance of catching them than J had of bringing dow .
ps a g d of bringing down | .
As we sallied forth, the day was just opening, and : ;
my chanticleer and his two mates were hopping to ) .
the ground from the higher branches of ahoneysuckle | :
tree (Banksia integrifolia, an umbragevus bush avout |

One vanced, A slight dew, just enough to deck the gras
\ with pearls hung upon the blades, having rather a
a frosty appearance where the long shadows of the tree:
, yet eclipsed it from the sun’s rays. At intervals the
magpie, though unseen, filled the valley with its louc
: bot sweet song, or rather bar of music. Here ant
| there a little bandicoot or a kangaroo rat would star
, 8) from beneath our feet, and run with the velocity of ar

Who has been splitting shingles here? asked Car.
rots, as we slowly wound our way through a small
thicket of stringy bark trees on the side of the hill. !

prey, he is said to be Shingle splitting, But the :
shingles that I had been splitting were real ones made |
out of the stringy bark trees. Never shall I forget
the first morning that I started with my seven feet i

for the approaching meal. The children amused (|) ae
themselves with gathering flowers, or admiring the : :
cockatoos and paroquets, or the motions of the kan- i .
garoos that occasionally bounded past us. The tree +a ;
was about 200 feet high to the top of the branches, | se
and about four feet through at 3 feet from the ground i ,
where we weie tocut. But never shall [ forget the 1) ie
toil E then endured, which it required all the enthu- | HY
siasm of a new settler to overcome, until my hand be- i
came habituated to the motions of the saw. I think I Need
feel the pain in my loins yet. It was the first strong %
exerCise I had had since wielding the quill and the
ferula on the banks of old Thames, or the cricket bat f
with Lambert as a bowler, on the Vine at Sevenoaks.
[t was the first step the schoolmaster took abroad, and vy
ITassure Mr. Browgham it was ten times barder than
any of his Jaboars in diffusing useful or entertaining
knowledge. As our saw approached the falling :
point, and the insertion of a wedge gave the tree a
bias, the reader may imagine my frequent lookings up a
at the wavings to and fro of the top branches along )
thesky. A good blast of wind in the direction we .
wanted would have saved me a world of trouble. [
had doffed my jacket, waistcoat, neckcloth, blistered |
my hands, and kept my handkerchief in my shirt
bosom to absorb the perspiration, You may imagine J
then the satisfaction [ had at last to see it plump
down & dasl its limbs to pieces, making the whole vale ‘
resound with the echo of its fall. I sat myself on the | ;
stump for a few minutes to Survey its gigantic length, ) ;
and to enjoy the victory of bringing it to the ground. pee
Its fall was a plumper more grateful to me than ever ||

, | ting no less than 1000 shingles with my own hand,
t sufficient to cover 10 feet square, or 100 square feet of
, my roof, This was shingle splitting, it was rusticating;
and it says much for the penetration of my excellent
f friend Tullias Cicero, that he should have spoken of
: the delights attendant on similar occupations as par-
§ taken by the poet Archia, in the Augustan age. Hoc

all trotted off. The country now became more open \)) ae
and our view was extended over undulating downs of a)
thinly wooded pasturage, with the blue lips of the | i
western mountains rising in the distance, [ere we ne ;
met another curiosity of the morning, It wasno less f
than the ruins ofa hut belonging to the notorious M4 i
bushman Micbael Howe. The floor which had been ian
neatly laid with bark, the fire place and great part of v
the thatched roof stiil remained. It stood in a secluded ae
spotona gentle slope concealed from behind bya ta
thick honey suckle tree, with an open view in front i
reaching down to a small stream of water. Near it ii
lay prostrate the trunk of a huge tree, on which he
had used to chop his meat for his own use and to feed i‘
his dogs. In crossing the little stream we chanced to ‘i
strike against his large iron pot hid in a tea tree bush, 4
which I afterwards carried home and still use for cu- iy
linary purposes. This was doubtless the place from Aus
which he last emerged when he met his death at the ,
Shannon hat, now the fertile estate of Hunterston. It '
is said that when his companion Warburton used to | M
visit Howe, so great was the distrust of that wretched if
man, that he obliged him to keep on the opposite ;
side of the trunk of the tree just mentioned on pain | ;
of being shet to death. It is scarcely possible to con-
celve a state of existence more traly miserable than J
this man must have led. With the remorse of the
most horrible robberies and murders on bis conscience,
be was here left to himself to contrast the native in- ) ;
nocence and serenity of God’s works with his own )
wicked heart, added to the hourly dread of apprehen- | ;
sion, The tumultuous laugh, the heated exhiliration |
of Companions in sin to drown reflection was wanting | :
tohim. The silent language of nature must have in- |
cessantly read him a lesson that would harrow up the |
soul, and bis countenance severed from the trank , ,

precipice. All at once a heavenly prospect burst
a upon the view. Atadepth beneath us of at least
600 feet, and at the bottom of a very steep bank, was
| seen gliding along like a canal for upwards of a mile
: the silent stream of the Ouse, at that time called the
Big river, until it was hid apon our left by the almost
: | perpendicular shoulder of the precipice on which we
) stood. The bank on the opposite side of the river
ii was nearly as steep and lofty as that on which we
; stood with the exception of the green plainof a valley
ae ranning up at right angles. The banks of this ro-
fi mantic valley though covered with grass were equally

7 i princely retreat so well described in Johnson’s Ras-
; , selas. Small parties of cattle were seen browsing in
; | places where they must with difficulty have kept
: their footing, while in parts they had formed a hori-
oH | zontal tract along the verge of the mountain. Just

t Hd} united volume cut for itself were here and there tobe
t | | seen the morning fogs as white as clouds of snew en-

vale, and thicket, up hill and down hill, led by ‘| ie
tire occasional glimpses of his own white shirt, 1! ;
still upon her back, as seen throughthe trees. At | ae
lasthe was obliged to abandon the chase, and he an. ;
had not been able since to rejoin his companions, || oe
to whom we now directed him, first giving bim a aa
couple of biscuits. I fear his object in chaining | i
the poorwoman was not exactly pure and disin- m
terested. ‘There is little doubt indeed but such,
and even worse treatment than this by the
stock-keepers in the earlier periods of the colo-
ny, 18 the chief and original cause of the hosti- i
lity which the aborigines have since indiserimi- is
nately shewn tothe whites. The man I am now b
speaking of, was afterwards hanged at Hobart- 4

Lhe trees which composed the forest we were now
traversing grow toa great height, and some of their |
trouks that bad fallen and Jay in our way obliged us
to go many yardsround, it being quite impracticable ;
to surmount them, being in some instances four or five ‘
yards in height. After travelling about four miles we
again emerged into light at the upper end of an ex- ae
tensive marsh or plain, about four or five miles in r
length and one or two broad, Pursuing our cuurse :
through some thick bushes that grow on the upper :
edge of this plain, for about another balf mile, jnst as :
the sun was setting, and gave to the Scene an en- | si
chanting serenity, we all at once found ourselves on ia
the border of an extensive lake. The pleasure we en- | |
joyed at the beautiful sight was enhanced by con-
ceiving ourselves the first discoverers of it among Eu- .
ropeans, and we stood upon the sandy beach viewing |

We were now entering upon tliat extensive tract
of country known by the name of Patrick’s plains,
so called inrememberance of Captain Patrick Wood
of Denniston, who was the first t. locate them. They
lie on both sides ofthe Shannon, bat stretch out on

the eastern side to a very great extent, being about

| ten miles in length, and varying from 2 to 5 or 6 miles
in width. Being in 60 lofty aregion, and in Many

parts entirely without a tree, they are however bleak,

and exposed to the western winds. Having crossed

| the river nearly at the top or northern end of these
plains, as they lay extended before us, the tops of the
trees were only to be seen like small shrubs bere and

there in the remote horizon. In one part we entered

upon a large flat, overgrown with tufts of coarse

crass, standing from 2to3 feet high. The wate

which in the wet season must have overflown thi:

| tract, had gradually washed away the ground from
between the tufts, leaving them like acrowd of little

stumps between which the foot was every minut
1 slipping. When we expected to set our foot apon th
| solid taft down it would pop 18 inches or 2 fee!
| deeper than we calculated upon. Nothing could b
more tiresome than such a progress, and after tra

versing it about a mile, fairly exhausted, we sat dow!

while we rested at this place, he made himself a | 3

inch and a half larger than the sole of the foot, with i
the exception of the heel part, which is cut square Hy
off, after sewing up the heel with needle and thread, Ve
he cut holes all round the fore part, through which ee
he strung a thong of the same skin, which being , vs
drawn together over the instep, (the fur being inside ) |
a very good slipper or sandal was made for his foot. oh)
We had toiled about two miles through this trea- ii
cherous ground, when we arrived on a considerable yn
part of it that had recently been burned down, ey
lonbtless by the Natives dropping their fire as they it
sarried their torches from one resting place tu ano- ny
ther. In thisinstanee we were thankful for the effects iy)
of their fires, for they enabled us to proceed with i
sreater s€curity, as we could now see where to place ii
bur feet, although on a dirty black tuft cf burned ai
pfass. On looking round we saw that the flame which i
Carrots had begun had already spread to a great dis- ni
ance more than half a mile in length, Svon after this Mi
jowever we came on smoother grass, and the country | *
tltogether assumed a warmer and more agreeable as. f
sect. The plain was here and there diversified with die,
sentle acclivities and occasional tongues or promonto- us
Tes of forest land clad with lofty umbragecus trees, | fi)
utted out and overhung the edges of the plain, and | ec
fi one part, towards the left, we discovered an exten- | as
ive lagoon of deep water. Great part of this fine Hi
‘fazing country bas since been located and converted Wht

Having surmounted this ridge we again reached the tl ee

beautiful little march containing about 1000 acres of ae
rich land into which we descended. This was the §

of ascending. The country appears likeamap stretch- f

the north end of Mamaisland. Beyond this are the ny
farms of Nir. Sharp and Nir. Fisher, opposite to i
which is a long hard Sandy beach, on which the Ho- A

no boat could enter. Major Honnor formerly made Wi ;
s settiement at South Port, and builta hut in the y
inuer harbour, about 3 or 4 miles from the entrance ipa 4
of the bay, Owing toits remote and unprotected | Be
situation for the female members of his family, he :
found it expedient at that time to abandon it. The Pal 4
tide flows about 6 miles up to the fresh water river tie
which is a considerable stream. The timber which |
grows near the hank is of very small diameter, bat
exceeds in height and straightness any yet scenin the
