Introduction
                               The Year in Review
                               It is with pleasure that I present the 2020-21 Annual Report on behalf of the Southern Midlands Council.

                               It goes without saying that the ongoing challenges associated with the management of COVID-19
                               were the main focus of the period.

                               Despite the limitations and restrictions associated with the pandemic, Council were able to advance
                               a number of key strategic projects. In relation to physical works, in excess of $6 million worth of capital
                               projects were completed during the financial year and they are detailed throughout this report.

Following many years of planning, the engagement of VOS Construction as the preferred Contractor to build the Oatlands
Aquatic Centre was certainly a highlight for Council. The project is advancing in accordance with the anticipated timeframe,
with a completion date of March 2022.

Council also completed a review of its Waste Management Strategy during the reporting period with the desired overarching
outcomes of the Strategy being to achieve progress according to the underlying principle of waste management in Australia,
the ‘waste management hierarchy’, which is to: maximise the useful life of materials; reduce, reuse and recycle waste;
recover as much energy out of what is left, and dispose of the remainder sensibly. Waste management is certainly a major
issue in terms of escalating costs, and this will continue to raise challenges going forward.

Oatlands Accommodation Facility - following a robust expression of interest process, Council has identified a preferred
proponent to advance negotiations. This negotiation process is focussed on achieving the best outcome that will see the
advancement of this project.

Council continued to support a number of local clubs and organisations through Council’s Community Small Grants Program.
It is interesting to note that since the inception of the Small Grants Program in 2007, Council have paid out an amount of
$337,697 which has supported $1,157,942.00 worth of Community Projects.

In regard to planning and development, the 2020-21 period saw further growth with significant developments taking place
across the entire municipal area. As with previous years, there was considerable growth in residential development
particularly in the Bagdad and Campania areas. I also acknowledge the ongoing capital investment in the agricultural
sector which is focussed on maximising the potential and availability or irrigation water.
2020/21 Annual Report | Southern Midlands Council                                                                               Page 7 of 97

An intense rain event in October 2020 caused considerable damage and trauma for residents, primarily in the Bagdad,
Mangalore and Broadmarsh areas. Council has since been proactive in identifying the scope of projects to mitigate these
risks going forward, and I am pleased to report that a number of the major projects have since been allocated funding. They
include Roberts Road and Blackbrush Road, Mangalore; Hal Lane, Bagdad and Elderslie Road in Broadmarsh township.

In terms of elected members, it would remiss not to acknowledge the passing of Mr Desmond Manning who was a highly
valued and respected member of the Municipality of Oatlands from 1971 to 1993 and the Southern Midlands Council from
1993 to 2005.

I would also like to recognise and congratulate Clr Tony Bisdee OAM who received a Local Government Association of
Tasmania Life Membership Award in July 2020. This was awarded in recognition of his long and outstanding service to the
whole of Local Government. His involvement with Local Government extends back to April 1972 when he was first elected to
the Green Ponds Council (part of the present Southern Midlands Council area).

In closing, I acknowledge my fellow elected members who continue to work tirelessly on behalf of the community, and I
commend the outstanding efforts and commitment of all staff, where in partnership, we have still been able to deliver great
outcomes.

I recommend this Annual Report to you.




Clr Alex Green
MAYOR




2020/21 Annual Report | Southern Midlands Council                                                                Page 8 of 97

Overview
Update from the General Manager
This Annual Report is one of four major documents produced by Council each year to ensure public accountability. They are the:

    <U+F0B7>   Strategic Plan;
    <U+F0B7>   Annual Operational Plan;
    <U+F0B7>   Annual Budget; and
    <U+F0B7>   Annual Report and Financial Statement.

All of these documents are available to the public.

The Local Government Act 1993 requires Council to provide a summary of the Operational Plan for the year including performance in
respect of targets set for the period. The following section of the Annual Report details the key achievements during the 2020/21 reporting
period. The format of the Annual Report is consistent with the respective strategic themes contained in Council’s Strategic Plan -
Infrastructure; Growth; Landscapes; Lifestyle; Community; and Organisation.

This Annual Report provides an informative overview of Councils’ operations for the 2020-21 period and highlights the achievements in
meeting the objectives and activities identified in the Strategic Plan.

Financial Performance

The audited financial statements were prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Australian Accounting Standards and are
appended to this report.

Council has reported an underlying deficit of $35K for the year ended 30 June 2021 ($135K surplus for the year ended 30 June 2021). This
is consistent with Council’s Long-term Financial Plan. The Underlying Surplus is lower than the ‘Result from continuing operations’ surplus of
$1.978 million. The ‘Underlying Surplus/Deficit’ is an adjusted figure that is the recurrent income (excluding income received specifically
for new or upgraded assets, physical resources received free of charge, or other income of a capital nature) of Council for a financial
year less the recurrent expenses for that financial year. The Underlying Surplus/Deficit figure allows a more accurate comparison of
continued operations between years as it is adjusted to exclude anomalies.

In calculating the underlying surplus, Grants for Capital related works are excluded. These totalled $2,045K.

An unqualified Audit Opinion was received from the Tasmanian Audit Office on the 30th September 2021.




2020/21 Annual Report | Southern Midlands Council                                                                                  Page 9 of 97

Other highlights for the past year include:

    <U+F0B7>   Capital expenditure in excess of $2.2 million on roads and bridges (detail presented within the report);
    <U+F0B7>   Completion of the Destination Playground in Callington Park, Oatlands ($500K);
    <U+F0B7>   Significant capital spending on recreation grounds and community halls ($461K), all aimed at maintaining serviceability and to
        meet the needs of the community; and
    <U+F0B7>   The Australian Government allocating in excess of $2 million for a range of road and community infrastructure.

The performance and highlights this year also need to recognise the challenges presented by Coronavirus (COVID -19). The uncertainty
surrounding the virus and the restrictions put in place to restrict it not only had a significant impact on the community but also Councils’
operations.

In closing, I acknowledge the leadership and contributions provided by the Mayor and all elected members, and the achievements and
outcomes documented in this report would certainly not have been possible without the full support of all employees.

Roads
MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE STANDARD AND SAFETY OF ROADS IN THE MUNICIPAL AREA

2020-21 Achievements
The total road length for the municipal area is 812 kilometers, which are classified as the following:

<U+F0A7> 32 kilometres – Urban Sealed
<U+F0A7> 175 kilometres – Rural Sealed
<U+F0A7> 605 kilometres – Rural Unsealed

Road projects, totaling $1.921 million were capitalised at the end of the 2020/21 financial year. These included:

<U+F0A7>     $487k on re-sheeting unsealed roads;
<U+F0A7>     $690k on reconstruction and resealing roads – Chauncy Vale Road, Huntingdon Tier Road, Cliftonvale Road, Lower
      Marshes Road, Old Main Road (Jericho), Goodwins Road, Rhyndaston Road, Native Corners Road and Woodsdale
      Road;
<U+F0A7>     $689k on new seal – Huntingdon Tier Road, Native Corners Road, Ballyhooly Road, Rhyndaston Road, Eldon Road and
      dust suppressants on Cornish’s Road, York Plains Road, Brown Mountain Road and Blackgate Road;
<U+F0A7>     $55k on other road safety improvements, including corner widening, kerb and gutter, carparks and installation of safety
      railing.

This level of capital expenditure has been possible due to the ongoing funding received through the ‘Roads to Recovery’
Program by the Australian Government. The objective of Roads to Recovery is to contribute to the Infrastructure Investment
Program through supporting maintenance of the nation’s local road infrastructure asset, which facilitates greater access for
Australians and improved safety, economic and social outcomes. The Roads to Recovery program does not contain a sunset
clause under the new National Land Transport Act 2014 meaning no new legislation will be required for the continuation of
the program.

From 2019-20 to 2023-24, the Southern Midlands Council will receive a total of $3,327,655 Roads to Recovery Funding, of which
$665,531 was received in 2020-21.

In 2020-21, the Federal Government announced the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program (LRCI) in response
to COVID -19, as a source of economic stimulus. The Program has been implemented in three phases. The Southern Midlands
Council received $665,531 for Phase 1 and $609, 032 for Phase 2. Most of the projects nominated under this program for Phase
1 and Phase 2 have been for road, footpath and drainage projects. We will receive a further $1,331,062 under Phase 3 of the
program in 2021/22 and 2022/23.

Roads
Road Traffic Counter

The Road Traffic Counter was placed on a number of roads during the reporting period. Use of the counter is aimed at gaining
a better understanding of the road network; the level of use (i.e. traffic numbers), and the type of vehicles travelling individual
roads. This information is valuable in the budgeting process, where there is always a need to prioritise capital expenditure
projects.

Finalisation of the road condition assessment and associated revaluation of road assets was deferred in 2020/21 due to COVID
-19. The road condition assessment and revaluation will be completed in the 2021/22 financial year.

Road Reconstruction (including reseal works) Tenders

Awarded to Stabilised Pavements of Australia (SPA) for an amount of $514,754 (GST excl.)

Major roads to be reconstructed and resealed included Native Corners Road, Eldon Road, Rhyndaston Road and Woodsdale
Road.

Major roads for reseal included:- Chauncy Vale Road, Huntingdon Tier Road, Rhyndaston Road, Clifton Vale Road, Ballyhooly
Road, Goodwins Road, Native Corners Road, Old Main Road (Jericho), Stonehenge Road and Woodsdale Road.

Specific Purpose Grants

Council secured a grant through the Department of State Growth under the Black Spot Programme for an amount of $150,000
to remodel and improve the Elderslie Road / Bluff Road junction.

In addition, an amount of $200,000 was approved under the Vulnerable Road Users Program to undertake improvements at
the junction of Reeve Street and Clime Street, Campania. This program is also managed by the Department of State Growth.
Council will provide a contribution of $50,000. A number of recommendations from the Campania Structure Plan (Circa 2016)
can be implemented through this grant allocation, which is consistent with Community expectations in Campania.

Australian Government Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program

In May 2020, the Australian Government announced a new $500 million Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program
(LRCI Program). Through the 2020–21 Budget, the Australian Government announced a $1 billion extension of the LRCI
Program, following strong community and local government support.


This program supports local councils to deliver priority local road and community infrastructure projects across Australia,
supporting jobs and the resilience of local economies to help communities bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Councils will be able to access funding under the extension to the LRCI Program Extension from 1 January 2021.

Under the LRCI Program Extension, Southern Midlands Council will receive an additional funding allocation of $609,032. This
funding will be available from 1 January 2021, with the Program being extended until the end of 2021.

Bridges
MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE STANDARD AND SAFETY OF BRIDGES IN THE MUNICIPAL AREA

2020-21 Achievements
There are 167 bridges and major culverts within the municipal area, with a total deck area of 8,221m2. $54,388 (excluding
depreciation) was expended on the maintenance of bridges within the municipal area. Maintenance expenses have
declined in recent years due to Council’s pro-active renewal and replacement program.

No bridge renewal / replacements projects were completed and capitalised at the end of the 2020/21 financial year,
however there were works in progress on the Woodsdale Road (Nutting Garden Rivulet) Bridge and the York Plains Road
(Kitty’s Rivulet) Bridge.

The written down value of Council’s bridges as at 30 June 2021 was $18.729 million (total replacement value of $28,263,318).

Council continues to engage AusSpan (Total Bridge Management) to undertake a full condition assessment of all Bridges on
a quarterly basis. This is a valuable contracted service that ensures Council is up to date with maintenance on all of their
bridge assets. AusSpan also provides an independent asset valuation of all bridges for inclusion in the financial statements.

Walkways, Cycleways & Trails
MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE STANDARD AND SAFETY OF WALKWAYS, CYCLEWAYS AND PEDESTRIAN AREAS TO PROVIDE
CONSISTENT ACCESSIBILITY

2020-21 Achievements
Ongoing maintenance of all walkways, cycle ways and pedestrian areas occurred during the reporting period.

$237,002 was expended on maintenance and minor improvements on footpaths and walkways throughout the municipal
area.

Walkway renewal / replacements projects, totalling $234k were capitalised at the end of the 2020/21 financial year.

A section of footpath on Louisa Street, Kempton, was upgraded, providing easier and safer access to the school.

The Caves Loop and Sanctuary Bridge was completed at Chauncy Vale, and a dual purpose walkway/cycleway was
completed in the Campania Bush Reserve.

Work continues on upgrades to the Lake Dulverton Walkway.

The ongoing program of upgrading footpaths in the village of Kempton continued with work carried out on Main Street, in
the vicinity of the Hall.

Work continued on the East Bagdad Road footpath and on the Broadmarsh and Tunnack Streetscape Projects.

Many of these projects are fully or partially funded by the Federal Government, including the Louisa Street footpath; the
Sanctuary Bridge at Chauncy Vale; the walkway/cycleway at Campania; upgrades to Main Street footpaths in the vicinity
of the Hall in Kempton; and the Broadmarsh Streetscape project.

Lighting
ENSURE ADEQUATE LIGHTING BASED ON DEMONSTRATED NEED AND CONTESTABILITY OF ENERGY SUPPLY

2020-21 Achievements
Additional street lighting has been approved / provided in accordance with Council’s Street-lighting Policy.

An amount of $89,159 was paid to Aurora Energy in 2020/21 for street lighting. Council continues to receive the benefits
associated with entering into a combined contract between Councils and Aurora Energy, facilitated and coordinated by
the Local Government Association of Tasmania.

Council continued with the next stage of the Oatlands Underground Power Project between High Street and Barrack Street
on the Northern end of Esplanade. This Project, in support of the gentrification of the street character in the Historic Precinct
of Oatlands, is funded by a $250k Federal Government grant. $162k of the Project was carried out in 2020/21.

Buildings
MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE STANDARD AND SAFETY OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN THE MUNICIPAL AREA

2020-21 Achievements
Council has ownership and is responsible for maintaining a large stock of public buildings. There are a variety of uses such as:
Council offices; community hall and recreation facilities; heritage buildings; buildings within parks and reserves; housing; and
public toilets.

In undertaking a revaluation of buildings in 2020/21, Council identified buildings and land which were not included in previous
financial statements, comprising a fair value of $1.5m for buildings and $490k for land.

Following revaluation and inclusion of the additional assets, total replacement value of these buildings is assessed at $46.9
million, with a current written down value of $22.4 million. This compares to a total replacement value of buildings of $24.5
million, with a written down value of $13.9 million in 2019/20.

Building projects completed in 2020/21 include:

    <U+F0B7>   Callington Mill (repointing and window repairs);
    <U+F0B7>   Campania Recreation Ground (barrier net);
    <U+F0B7>   Playgrounds improvements in Campania (Alexander Circle and Justitia Court);
    <U+F0B7>   Runnymede Recreation Ground (resurfacing and watering system);
    <U+F0B7>   Colebrook Hall (heating upgrade);
    <U+F0B7>   Oatlands Destination Playground at Callington Park; and
    <U+F0B7>   Mount Pleasant Recreation Ground Toilet Upgrade.

Whilst a total of $4.6 million was expended in Capital Projects in 2020/21, some of these projects were recorded as Works in
Progress as at 30th June 2021. They included:

    <U+F0B7>   Kempton Community Health Centre;
    <U+F0B7>   Kempton Memorial Hall (access and portico); and
    <U+F0B7>   Oatlands Aquatic Centre.

Buildings
Heritage Hub

Heritage Hub evolving from Social Enterprise to that of an Artist in Residence Space. The buildings at 79 High Street, Oatlands
were revitalized & restored using heritage & traditional skills & trades with funds from Economic Development Grants. They
went on to become the home of heritage skills & trades, with the Commissariat being the home of Centre for Heritage & the
shop front being the Heritage Hub social enterprise. The Heritage Hub was a cooperative of 17 local Artists & a small group
of volunteers who successfully operated & used the space until the COVID -19 shut downs. The undertakings of this original
project demonstrated the potential use of the building in housing permanent exhibits & space for working artists.

Since re-opening the space has since hosted Residencies, with Artists, Anna Mackrell & Mike Brady with exhibitions & sales of
their works.

Sewers / Water
INCREASE THE CAPACITY TO ACCESS TO RETICULATED SEWERAGE SERVICES
INCREASE THE CAPACITY AND ABILITY TO ACCESS WATER TO SATISFY DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO RETICULATED
WATER OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN THE MUNICIPAL AREA

2020-21 Achievements
At 30 June 2021, Council held a 0.72% ownership interest in TasWater, based on schedule 2 of the Corporation’s constitution,
which reflects Council’s voting rights. The total value of Council’s investment increased by $958,000 to $11.348 million.

$76,000 was received from TasWater via dividends and tax equivalent payments.

In September 2018, Council endorsed a number of resolutions which were submitted to a Special General Meeting of
TasWater. The intent of these of these resolutions were to implement changes, and formally introduce prior negotiated
agreements associated with the State Government’s injection of $200 million in equity over 10 years. The State Government
will receive a total 10% equity over the ten-year period, but will not receive dividends during that period. The resolutions
related to the adoption of a new Constitution; pricing; adoption of a new ‘Shareholders’ Letter of Expectations’; and Share
subscriptions agreement.

Whilst Council’s distribution entitlement of $152K per annum was secured though to the end of the 2025/26 financial year
under this new arrangement, due to the financial effects of Covid-19 on TasWater, there was only one dividend distribution
in 2020/21 resulting in Council receiving half of our distribution entitlement.

Drainage
MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE TOWN STORM-WATER DRAINAGE SYSTEMS

2020-21 Achievements

This program relates to the provision of piped stormwater drainage assets within the various towns and villages. It does not
include roadside drainage systems on rural roads.

Best Practice Design

Council continues to appraise, implement and monitor ‘Water Sensitive Urban Design’ (WSUD) through the Development
Application and Engineering process. This provides more opportunity for rain water to soak into the local water table. WSUD
is typically implemented through subdivision design which complements the village character of the Southern Midlands
townships.

Capital Works

Capital projects totalling $8,178 were capitalised at the end of the 2020/21 financial year. Preparation work also began on
two new drainage projects in Blackbrush Road and Hall Lane.

The total replacement value of our drainage assets is assessed at $5.3 million, with a current written down value of $3.8 million.
Drainage – October 2020 Inundation Event

An intense rain event in October 2020 caused considerable damage and trauma for residents in the Bagdad, Mangalore,
Broadmarsh areas and Council have been proactive in identifying the scope of individual projects to mitigate the effect of
such events in the future.

In responding to such events as significant inundation, it is a positive for the community and for Council in addressing legacy
issues that have been in the area for many years with only interim solutions being undertaken in the past.

A significant emergency budget allocation was made available and Council Officers developed action plans to implement
remedies to a number of these issues. Whilst not all issues could be dealt with, many were addressed. It has been evident
over recent years that inundation events have intensified and there appears to be a greater frequency between events.

Drainage
Whilst Council is working through storm water issues, we are unable to future proof against intense rainfall events and property
owners will have to be vigilant in trying to put mitigation measures in place and keep up a higher intensity maintenance
regime to assist in protecting against property damage.

Waste
MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE PROVISION OF WASTE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY

2020-21 Achievements
A review of the Southern Midlands Council Waste Management Strategy (developed in 2016) was completed in 2020.

The desired overarching outcomes of the Strategy are to achieve progress according to the underlying principle of waste
management in Australia, the ‘waste management hierarchy’, which is to: maximise the useful life of materials; reduce, reuse
and recycle waste; recover as much energy out of what is left, and dispose of the remainder sensibly.

Waste management is a significant logistics operation for Southern Midlands Council – an operation that manages in the
order of 2360 tonnes of waste annually plus recyclables (around 360 tonnes/year). On a per-capita basis, Southern Midlands
Council manages around 444 kg/person/year of municipal waste. These excludes scrap metals and green waste, which is
stockpiled at each of the three waste transfer stations.

The cost of running the waste management operation is increasing steadily which is primarily due to; the increasing cost of
waste disposal; increasing amount of waste; and increasing cost burden associated with managing recyclables. Combined
waste and recyclables cost council in the order of $423/tonne to manage.

Waste Transfer Stations - Council currently operates three WTSs (for waste and recyclables). These are located at Oatlands,
Dysart and Campania. A number of operational changes have been made to improve the safety and efficiency of the
stations.

Waste Transfer Station Contract

In October 2020, Council awarded the Contract for the collection, disposal and provision of bins at each of the three Waste
Transfer Station(s) to Spectran. This followed a detailed Request for Tender process. The contract is for five (5) years with a
possible one (1) year extension.

Residential
INCREASE THE RESIDENT, RATE PAYING POPULATION IN THE MUNICIPALITY

2020-21 Achievements

Council continues to ensure a sufficient supply of residential land in the Southern Midlands for the next 10-15 years and beyond. This is
achieved through monitoring the progress of past strategic plans, the development of the new Oatlands Structure Plan and reviewing
the current residential zoning through the preparation of the Local Provisions Schedule of the Tasmanian Planning Scheme.

Overall the municipality has experienced a high level of residential growth this year, with the southern areas continuing to have the
highest approvals. 62 new dwellings were approved in the 2020/2021 year, which is almost twice the number approved in 2019/2020.

Strong residential development is expected to continue with subdivisions progressing in Campania, Kempton and Bagdad as well as
growing interest in Oatlands and surrounding settlements.

Council Officers work closely with subdivision developers and build strong working relationships. This ensures quality planning and urban
design outcomes will be achieved. This is an attitude fostered by Council and Management.

Planning and Building approvals are always issued within the statutory timeframes and Council Officers provide advice and guidance to
applicants where needed. The average time for assessment of a Discretionary Development Application is 37 days (from 42 days) and
the average time for a Permitted Development Application is 16 days (from 28 days).

INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TOURISTS VISITING AND SPENDING MONEY IN THE MUNICIPALITY

2020-21 Achievements

Destination Southern Tasmania

Council continues to be a financial member of Destination Southern Tasmania (DST). Council Officers and Elected members
have worked on the Heritage Highway Destination Action Plans (DAP) for the Region, with Council to consider specific
initiatives going forward.
Proposed large scale tourism accommodation facility in Oatlands

The proposed large scale tourism accommodation facility in Oatlands, which was identified in the Midlands Economic
Development and Land use Strategy project as being a key missing element in the area’s tourism infrastructure, is an ongoing
project for Council with the aim of attracting private investment in such a facility. At the same time, Council continues to
negotiate with Tasmania Police with the aim of securing ownership of the property in Barrack Street, Oatlands (as this borders
the preferred development site).
Following an ‘expression of interest’ process, Council has identified a preferred proponent for the development and
negotiations are continuing.

INCREASE THE NUMBER AND DIVERSITY OF BUSINESS IN THE SOUTHERN MIDLANDS; INCREASE EMPLOYMENT WITHIN THE MUNICIPALITY;
INCREASE COUNCIL REVENUE TO FACILITATE BUSINESS AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES (SOCIAL ENTERPRISE)

2020-21 Achievements




Southern Midlands Council is a key player in bringing together this initiative.

                                                    ‘Local Jobs for Local People’

The Workforce Development Project provides a crucial platform for working together on the complex challenges that are not
effectively being dealt with separately across the labour market. This Project is a collaborative effort, being driven by Anthony
McConnon and his very able assistant Gemma Winton, with diverse industries/businesses and initiatives contributing to the
shared strategic agenda across our four local government areas.

Our SCS Workforce Development Project, is premised on:

    <U+F0B7>   The region’s economic prosperity being dependent on the specialisations and competitiveness within and across key
        sectors that need to be underpinned by a workforce equipped with the skills to support such growth; and
    <U+F0B7>   An effective response to these challenges spans many sectors, organisations and responsibilities, suggesting a more
        networked and collaborative effort is now working to ensure businesses, often in competition with each other, have a
        new / better way of working together in understanding the labour market and getting great value out of our Project
        Team.

The outcomes to date have been amazing. The target employment to be achieved by the Team was set at 40 people in
work by the end of the first twelve months, the table below shows that in only nine months there has been 119 roles filled
across our four local government areas. Wow!! Thanks to the Tasmanian Community Fund for their support in funding this
Project over the three years, plus Workskills in also providing funding for the support role filled by Gemma.

Industry
RETAIN AND ENHANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RURAL SECTOR AS A KEY ECONOMIC DRIVER IN THE SOUTHERN MIDLANDS; INCREASE
ACCESS TO IRRIGATION WATER WITHIN THE MUNICIPALITY

2020-21 Achievements
As part of Council’s commitment to supporting sustainable land management practices in the agricultural industry, the
Weeds Officer from the NRM Unit has been encouraging landholders to manage / plan to eradicate high priority weeds from
landholdings. There has been an emphasis on agriculture, given the proportion of the Municipality that relies on rural land
production as an industry. Cotton, saffron and nodding thistles, Chilean Needle Grass and one area of Serrated Tussock and
Boneseed are the targeted priorities in the agricultural and urban landscape.

Discussions were held with Tasmanian Irrigation with the aim of highlighting the need and urgency of progressing both the
South East Irrigation Scheme options and the broader Southern Midlands Scheme.

Council continues to support the Midlands Water Scheme operations within the Municipality. The Council’s NRM officer sits
on the Midlands Water Scheme Irrigator Representative Committee as a representative for our rural landholders in a number
of regions.

Council continues to assist in promotion of field days related to agriculture and /or irrigation, particularly events that focus on
the latest technology and sustainable land management practices.

IDENTIFY AND PROTECT AREAS THAT ARE OF HIGH CONSERVATION VALUE; ENCOURAGE THE ADOPTION OF “BEST PRACTICE” LAND CARE
TECHNIQUES

2020-21 Achievements
The NRM Unit continues to provide best practice landcare information and assistance with weeds matters. Advice on native
tree species suitable for varying locations continues to be sought by ratepayers. The Midlands Tree Committee purchased
1190 trees, which were made available to landholders that had expressed an interest in undertaking some native tree
establishment works.

Weeds
Working in conjunction with the Works & Services Department, the priorities for treatment continue to be gorse, broome,
blackberry, Paterson’s Curse, Chilean Needle Grass and some thistle species. There are also very small amounts of Spanish
heath, pampas grass, serrated tussock and boneseed that are targeted. The Council’s Web site was updated to include
pictures of the various weeds. This enabled easier identification for ratepayers in regard to the priority weeds identified for
Southern Midlands.

Cumbungi in Lake Dulverton continues to be monitored and any plant sighted is dealt with. In the 19/20 year only 20 plants
were found and no plants in 20/21.

Cotton and saffron thistle works occurred at Woodbury via helicopter spraying targeting hard to access areas. This work was
funded by the State Government. Chilean Needle grass works occurred in the Coal Valley as a result of the State Government
funded ‘Action Fund Drought and Weed Management’ program.

Lake Dulverton
The Lake Dulverton Management Strategy 2002, and the Lake Dulverton Action Plan 2017 continue to provide guidance for
work around the lake. Works planned for the area known as the ‘pine tree’ area near Mahers Point were completed in
September 2020.

The water levels in the Recreation Zone of the Lake continue to be monitored with readings taken on a weekly basis. The
Midlands Water Scheme winter water take over 2020 saw Council place 215.0 ML of water into the lake. The current declining
water level trend continues to be of concern in respect to being able to maintain water in the Mary Island section of the lake,
being the area adjacent to the Oatlands Township. Council continues to look at long term options to address this concern.

Pathway works on the Lake foreshore commenced in June 2021 after several delays had occurred. Cold weather conditions
caused the path works to halt due to the nature of the product needing better drying conditions. The balance of the works
have been postponed to late 2021. Funding for the work has been made available through the Australian Government.

Campania Bush Reserve

Funding from the Australian Government of $100,000 was used for upgrading the pathway at the Campania Bush Reserve.
Works on an all-weather concrete pathway of 600metres commenced in February 2021. The path replaced the existing dirt
track and was opened in May 2021.

Chauncy Vale Wildlife Sanctuary

The financial year 2020/21 was a period of continued infrastructure upgrades, and
environmental management at Chauncy Vale. This work included:

Environmental
<U+F0B7>     Rivulet rehabilitation work, primarily at Day Dawn Creek. This grant funded project was commenced in June 2020 and
      involved revegetation and erosion control work. The project was completed in June 2021 and to date has been very
      successful with erosion control measures working, and greater than 95% survival rate in trees planted (approximately
      1000 trees).
<U+F0B7>     Additional tree planting was undertaken at Jacks Flat.
<U+F0B7>     A large cleanup effort was required after a freak low level snowfall brought down hundreds of small trees and saplings
      across the track network.
<U+F0B7>     Thistle control work has continued, the aim of which is to reduce the size of infestations and minimize the likelihood of
      further spread. Other potential weed incursions into the reserve are being monitored closely, for example cape weed
      which is prolific in the farmland to the west of Chauncy Vale.
Infrastructure Upgrades
<U+F0B7>     The pedestrian bridges project was completed and was a great success. The
      popular Caves Loop Track may now be undertaken regardless of water level in
      Browns Caves Rivulet.
<U+F0B7>     Four new picnic tables were made and installed on the deck of the meeting room.
<U+F0B7>     A new picket fence around the garden at Day Dawn Cottage was commenced
      and has been completed on the NE and NW sides of the garden.
<U+F0B7>     The Caves Loop Track was upgraded and improved on the rocky, steep section
      where it passes Brown’s Caves. John Hughes and his team undertook this work and
      it is of typically high standard and has made the track safer and easier to follow. The
      use of locally sourced stone means that the track work blends in well with the natural
      environment of the reserve.
                                                                                           Revegetation work at Chauncy Vale

Southern Midlands Arts Advisory Committee

The Committee continued to support the Lower Midlands Art Group “Artlands Exhibition” held at Dysart House, which again
drew an amazing crowd over the viewing time. The Exhibition theme is usually “Celebrating the Southern Midlands” however
it was decided that this year’s theme would be “Open” as the Artists would have been creating during the COVID -19
Lockdown and unable to venture out into our Region. The result was an astounding colour and diversity of subject within the
exhibition and the three “feature artists” sculptures were truly wonderful.

The Lower Midlands Collection is a project that supports artists of all disciplines who have lived or worked in the Southern
Midlands, or artists who have created artworks that celebrate or describe it. The group acquiring beautiful pieces for the
Collection including the purchase of one artwork annually from the ARTLands Exhibition. Each work of art is registered and
has a sign on it indicating that it is part of the Lower Midlands Collection. The Collection is then made available on an annual
leasing arrangement for local residents and business to “hire” a piece of artwork to display in their homes or work places.

The group has traditionally launched the annual event in the past by hosting a celebration luncheon and Lease Exhibition in
Kempton during July. Given the COVID -19 gathering restrictions of 2020 at the time however, an alternative means of provide
public access to this exhibition was sought. Council assisted the group to digitise the Lower Midlands Collection and to
develop a social media strategy to enable them to deliver the 2020 leasing program

A REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT IS SUPPORTIVE OF AND ENABLES APPROPRIATE DEVELOPMENT

2019-20 Achievements
Planning Reform
The Southern Midlands Draft Local Provisions Schedule (LPS) has now been prepared and exhibited for public comment. It is
expected that the adoption of the LPS as part of the Tasmanian Planning Scheme (TPS) will be completed early in 2022.
Council staff continue to work with the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) and other Council’s in the Southern Region
towards finalising this project.

The preparation of the LPS, and a single statewide planning scheme (TPS) is an objective of the State Government’s Phase 1
of Planning Reform. Southern Midlands have worked to ensure the draft LPS aligns with Council’s Strategic Plan, the Southern
Regional Land Use Planning Strategy, Local Planning Objectives and Strategy and overall is consistent with the Resource
Management and Planning System in Tasmania (and the statutory requirements of the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act
1993). The LPS contains local content that recognise the unique settlements, natural values, farming values and heritage
values.

In 2021 the State Government announced the Phase 2 Planning Reforms which are expected to take place over a 2-3 year
period. Phase 2 includes the following key components:

    <U+F0B7>   Introduction of the Tasmanian planning Policies;
    <U+F0B7>   Delivering an improved regional land use planning framework; and
    <U+F0B7>   Comprehensive reviews of the three Regional Land Use Strategies.

As these reforms progress Council staff will engage with the State Government to ensure that matters relevant to our
municipality are fully considered.

In the meantime the Planning Policy Unit will be working with councils and the regions to identify opportunities for planning
studies and analysis that can occur now to contribute to:

    <U+F0B7>   short-term updates to the three regional land use strategies to ensure they remain fit for purpose; and
    <U+F0B7>   the longer-term comprehensive reviews of the three regional land use strategies.

Regulatory
Council staff are working with the TPC and other municipalities in the region to identify strategic projects that could fit into
this reform program, such as new and updated structure plans for our towns in order to accommodate residential growth
and economic development.

Together, these reforms will significantly advance the level of strategic planning in Tasmania at a state and regional level,
providing essential guidance for Councils, property owners and developers considering future land use and development.
The draft LPS effectively implements many aspects of Council’s Strategic Plan including but not limited to:

<U+F0B7>     Providing a range of housing and land types for residents
<U+F0B7>     Ensuring a long term supply of residential land
<U+F0B7>     Identifying future urban growth through the application of zoning
<U+F0B7>     Protect key infrastructure and community assets
<U+F0B7>     Implement the STLRUS settlement strategy (which in turn facilitates healthy communities, better services, better transport
      and orderly development)
<U+F0B7>     Protect agricultural land from adverse land use, subdivision and development
<U+F0B7>     Ensure land is dedicated to general business and light industrial activities in strategically identified areas
<U+F0B7>     Allows Council to forward plan capital works and community programs

    <U+F0B7>   Written submissions to the General Manager.

In total, around 100 people provided feedback on the formation of the Structure Plan.

Phase 2 of the community consultation commenced in January 2021 with a 6 week exhibition period which included a
second public workshop and information session held at the Gay Street Hall on the 20 th January 2021. 17 members of the
community attended the session with further Council Officers and Councillors. A total of 11 written submissions were then
received during the exhibition. These submissions were tabled by the steering committee and individually considered.

Parking and traffic management remain central to the objectives of the structure plan and are clearly matters important to
the community and visitors to the town. This was strongly communicated to Council and JMG during the two (2) phases of
consultation.

The strong interest in the traffic and parking matters culminated in a standalone appendix in the Structure Plan. This was a
clear instruction from the steering committee.

Overall the objectives of the structure plan and themes of the structure plan are supported by stakeholders and those whom
have participated in the public consultation. Many of the ideas presented by the community have been furthered through
the plan.
The objectives of the project were:
•       Encourage greater visitor numbers to stop and stay for longer in Oatlands
•       Encourage greater retention of population and encourage new residents
<U+F0B7>       Support local business and service providers through improved town amenity, greater visitor numbers, and through
        residential and business growth
•       To involve the community in future use/development and accessibility to Callington Park
•       To maximise the use of space and linkages between key development areas
•       To ensure any plan is aligned with current State, Regional and Local Strategy
•       To attract further investment and funding for infrastructure
•       To leverage off planned development and the current values of the town.
•       Implement healthy urban design and modern open spaces; and
•       Continue to grow a healthy active community.
Many of these objectives should be realised through the implementation of the structure plan.

The Oatlands Structure Plan will be finalised in the early part of the 2021/22 period.

Approval of the Jerusalem Estate Specific Area Plan
In October 2020 the Tasmanian Planning Commission approved the amendment of the Southern Midlands Interim Planning
Scheme to include the Jerusalem Estate Specific Area Plan.
In May 2020 meeting, Council resolved to initiate a planning scheme amendment at the request of the Benedictine Monks
to develop a monastery, priory and associated visitor services areas at a 1000ha plus area farm south of Colebrook.
The rezoning allows for the community gathering and communal living areas whilst supporting the ongoing agricultural use
of the land.
In regard to social and economic outcomes, the proposed Jerusalem Estate is expected to create a unique community for
Tasmania, which is expected to attract interest and visitors to the Colebrook region. The potential visitor experiences will be
subservient to the primary purpose of the monastery, while providing economic support for the Priory. The Visitor Precinct is
located very close to the established Colebrook township and is expected to support the economic and cultural growth of
the town.

A total of $38.78 million worth of development was approved in the Southern Midlands during the 2020/201 reporting period.
This figure is based on the estimated cost of development as submitted at the time of the Development Application. The
figure does not include the cost of subdivision works (as accurate data is not provided by the applicant).

62 new dwellings were approved in the reporting period. 32 new dwellings were approved in the previous year. Council
continues to remain at the forefront of modern day best practice in the processing of building, plumbing and planning
applications through the electronic submission and assessment of applications for permits. Council Officers have a strong
focus on customer service and value the relationship with Applicants.

Climate Change
IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN RELATION TO ITS IMPACT ON COUNCIL’S CORPORATE FUNCTIONS
AND ON THE COMMUNITY.

2020-21 Achievements
Council’s recently updated Climate Change Action Plan guides Council’s ongoing approach to climate change
mitigation, the primary goal of which is to:

<U+F0B7>     continue efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over which council has control;
<U+F0B7>     assist the community to reduce emissions where possible; and
<U+F0B7>     collaborate on broader scale initiatives with regional stakeholders through involvement with the Regional Climate
      Change Initiative.

Council’s Climate Change Action Plan has three areas of focus:

1.    energy efficiency projects inclusive of solar and electric/hybrid vehicle upgrades;
2.    land care projects inclusive of tree planting and landscape protection options; and
3.    waste management projects that are related to emission reduction.

The primary energy efficiency project undertaken in 2020/21 was installation of a 16 kW solar PV system at Council’s depot
in Oatlands. The environmental outcome of this project is estimated to be equivalent to saving the burning of 7 tonnes of
coal per annum – which is the energy equivalent the imported energy that is offset by the project. It is estimated that the
annual financial return to council from the project is equivalent to around $2500 in offset energy use and energy exported
to the grid.

A Home Energy Assessment Toolkit (HEAT toolkit) is available from Council’s Kempton office as a take-home kit enabling
residents to undertake their own home energy use appraisals.

Kokedama Workshop

Due to the impact of COVID -19 on our communities there was a focus on activities that encouraged people out of isolation. We held a
Kokedama workshop in Colebrook as a fun way to encourage community members to try something new to maybe break down new barriers
in getting out & about again. A great time was had by all with the participants learning a new skill & eager to try it at home as an inexpensive
Christmas gift idea.

Oatlands Aquatic Centre

In May 2020 Council appointed a new Project Manager, Patrick Stanton and a new Architect, Peter Gaggin from Philp Lighten Architects to
‘re-start’ the development of the Oatlands Aquatic Centre after the stalled efforts of the previous Architect. They quickly moved with
Community Consultation and in June 2020 they lodged the Development Application for the project, following Council’s sign off on the design.
A Planning Permit was issued in July 2020. A further Community Consultation was undertaken.

Youth
INCREASE THE RETENTION OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE MUNICIPALITY

2020-21 Achievements

The very successful Southern Midlands Youth School Holiday continued, with a total of 8 separate activity days across four term breaks were
held between July 2020 and June 2021. The program provided opportunities for children aged between 9 and 16 years to increase physical
activity, improve social connectedness and engage in new and challenging experiences.

Due to COVID -19 restrictions during July 2020 the YAY! Team joined up with Oatlands Rural Youth to facilitate a “Youth Photography Comp”
for 12 –16 year old residents. We had a fabulous response to the activity with 19 entrants submitting some 50 brilliant photos under the theme
“Nature”.

Rural Youth invited photographer Denise Smith of Oatlands to judge the photos, selecting winning shots and her “favourites” from each age
year. Each winning entrant received a $25 voucher of their choice from either Village Cinemas, Zone 3, Barilla Putt & Play, Woody’s Skate &
Play or, Zone Bowling Moonah. Winners in the 15 &16 age years also received a 1 year membership to the Oatlands Rural Youth group, valued
at $120 each.

Youth
Across the other 3 term breaks, we had a total of 167 children participate across 7 activities, representing 10 of the local Southern Midlands’
townships. COVID -19 restrictions meant there were less places available due to capacity restrictions at venues & to allow for social distancing
measures.

Activities included Zone 3, SUPA-World, Port Arthur Historic Site, Launceston & Hobart Aquatic Centre’s, Village Cinemas, Laser Skirmish &
playgrounds as Lindisfarne, Kingston & Bellerive.

Council was once again most fortunate to benefit from Communities for Children/Hobart City Mission partial funding of these activities. The
holiday activity funding is allocated to assist families within our region for the benefit of children aged 9-12 years. Council provides for any
budgetary short-falls and for the program costs associated with activities for the 12-16 year age group.

INCREASE THE ABILITY OF SENIORS TO STAY IN THEIR COMMUNITY

2020-21 Achievements

Community Shed

The Community Shed at Oatlands continues to be a facility used by Seniors. It is been a place to come & learn new skills, engage Seniors in
the Community who may become isolated & a wonderful outlet for their mental health in being a part of a group, keeping active & socialising.
Membership at the Shed has steadily increased & operates three days a week. They raise funds for equipment by regularly creating objects
for sale at the local Oatlands Community market & hold regular ‘Come & Try’ days to encourage the community to learn how to use power
tools safely & open days over a bbq & a chat with guest speakers. Community Development staff assisted Shedders to apply for grant funding
that they were successful with & now owners of new equipment & safety gear.

Seniors
Council of the Aged (COTA)
Council supported the education workshops with COTA (Council of the Aged) in the Southern Midlands. Regular workshops were held online
& in person to keep Seniors informed at staying well at home, accessing aged care services, elder abuse, volunteer opportunities, managing
medications, and link Seniors into nearby programs such as the free legal advice for Older Tasmanians, IT skills support, COVID -19 suppor &
Living Longer, Living Stronger program. The main theme this year has been on the Vaccine rollout & access, eSafety along with keeping
connected with each other.

Community Walks

Council supported Seniors by engaging them in monthly ‘Community Walks’ that were facilitated in partnership with Tasmanian Health Service
staff & combining with Seniors from the Central Highlands. The physical & emotional support participants provided to each other whilst being
able to get out & about were really evident this year as the walks started up again after COVID -19 restrictions eased, albeit social distanced.
Community walk locations included Tungatinah Lagoon, Chauncy Vale, Curringa Farm. Great Lake, Botanic Gardens, Mt Field & Snug Falls.

Children & Families
ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE CHILDCARE SERVICES, AS WELL AS OTHER FAMILY RELATED SERVICES, ARE FACILITATED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY

2020-21 Achievements
The Council contributes to the Brighton Family Day-Care for managing the family day care service that caters for the Southern Midlands local
government area.

The old Oatlands pool (circa 1954) continued to be a focal point of activities for children and families during the summer months when it is
open.

There was a greater emphasis on making sure services for children & family came to the region rather than being based towards the City and
to promote local services available to help families when necessary. Village based collection of food boxes, promoting additional transport
services, a weekly fresh vegetables stall, Pop up play days & emergency relief services were all provided within the Southern Midlands.

                                         community informed as we have all learned to live alongside COVID -19. There was a greater
                                         emphasis on information sharing about how to move forward with support pages for local
                                         businesses adapting to re-opening with QR codes for checking in & COVID -19 safety information
                                         as we all go back to our daily lives. As the year progressed, the focus was on promoting local
business & event pages, encouraging people to ‘shop local’

Council continued to co-facilitate the Combined Service Provider Network Group in collaboration with Central Highlands. Meetings were held
alternately in Ouse and Kempton every 2nd month where health and wellbeing services were invited to provide updates regarding their services
& activities for residents across the two municipalities.

Recreation
PROVIDE A RANGE OF RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES THAT MEET THE REASONABLE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY

2020-21 Achievements

Oatlands Aquatic Centre – see Community Health & Wellbeing Program

Runnymede Recreation Ground
The Runnymede Recreation Ground has been resurfaced with the aid of a grant from the Department of Communities and further investment
by Council, along with the Runnymede Cricket Club and the Runnymede Volunteer Fire Brigade.
The Runnymede Recreation Ground (Cricket Ground) has suffered for many years because of successive drought conditions. The site
surrounding the Recreation Ground in 2010 was planted out in a eucalyptus niten hardwood plantation which drew wildlife into the Recreation
Ground and eroded the surface. At that point in time the whole area including the Recreation Ground was owned by Gunns Ltd. The
Runnymede Cricket Club was very keen to upgrade the ground but the barrier was that it was in private ownership. Southern Midlands Council
were very keen to assist and entered into an arrangement with Gunns Ltd to transfer the site into Public Open Space in Council ownership.
Part the way through the process Gunns Ltd went into liquidation, so the process had to be abandoned. The new owner’s structure was
formalised after many months and Council started talks with the new owners. After a couple of years negotiations, including a subdivision, the
title of the Recreation Ground is now in Council ownership, formally designated Public Open Space.
Council has now, in partnership with the Runnymede Cricket Club completed the process of redevelopment of this ground for this historic
cricket club. The achievements that we have collectively created comprises the following, which in total, we have brought this ground up to
a high quality condition and drought proofing it for future generations.
1.           Bore;
2.           Onsite Water storage 100,000 litre storage tank;
3.           Irrigation System: Sports ground irrigation has been installed;
4.           Ground Surface: The renovation of the surface to create a high quality playing surface.

Off-lead parks are a great place for people to socialise their dogs and to exercise and socialise with one another.

Regional Cat Management Strategy

In March 2021, Council endorsed the Southern Tasmania Regional Cat Management Strategy 2021-2026.

The preparation of a Cat Management Strategy dates back to March 2020 when the Southern Tasmanian Councils Authority provided in-
principle support for the development of a Regional Strategy. This decision followed the allocation of funds by the State Government to employ
three Regional Cat Management Coordinators to help progress cat management in Tasmania. The Southern Coordinator (Nikki Brockman) is
hosted by Kingborough Council.

The Strategy is based on an ‘opt-in’ approach based on available resources, and taking into account the extent of the problem within each
municipal area. The intent of the Strategy is to provide consistency of approach depending on the approach taken by individual Councils.

Council has continued to work in conjunction with local Tasmania Police and Department of State Growth officers on various
road safety matters. The Variable Message Board roadside trailer is used regularly to promote road safety messages on the
Midland Highway and surrounding major roads. The trailer is also used as part of a cohesive program of highway signage
during major events that attract large traffic numbers e.g. Symons Plains V8 car racing, Launceston Cup or festive season
Food Festivals. Together with DIER’s “Real Mates” program, this program is part of Council’s Community Road Safety
Partnership.

2020-21 Achievements
Work, Health & Safety / Risk Management

Two meetings of the Work, Health & Safety / Risk Management Committee were held during the reporting period.

Information, Communication & Technology Systems

In June 2021, Council engaged Taylor Mitchell (external consultant) to undertake a review of Council’s ICT platforms and
prepare a ‘technology strategy and road map’. This project was initiated as a result of Council’s existing software suppliers
providing advice that they will discontinue support and development of the currently deployed products, as each vendor
have now moved to newer, more modern cloud based solutions.

In addition, the council-owned hardware is fast approaching end of life and will be due for replacement in the next 3-9
months. This will result in operational and system support issues, and will likely result in an increased cyber security risk to
Council.

Council now finds itself in a position where investment in ICT is required to ensure business continuity and manage the current
risk. Such an investment is also an opportunity to reduce ongoing costs and ICT complexity, and to set itself up for a modern
operating environment for the future.

This project will be finalised in the 2021/22 financial year with the selection, configuration and implementation of a new
solution.

Prepared in pursuance of the provisions of the Local Government Act 1993 (as amended), the
Statements of Accounting Concepts and applicable Accounting Standards, including the accrual basis
of accounting.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Councillors of Southern Midlands Council
Report on the Audit of the Financial Report


Opinion
I have audited the financial report of Southern Midlands Council (Council) and its
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as
at 30 June 2021 and consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity
and cash flows for the year then ended, notes to the financial statements, including a
summary of significant accounting policies, other explanatory notes and the statement of
certification by the General Manager.
In my opinion, the accompanying financial report:
   (a) present fairly, in all material respects, the Group’s financial position as at 30 June
       2021 and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended
    (b) is in accordance with the Local Government Act 1993 and Australian Accounting
        Standards.
Basis for Opinion
I conducted the audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of
the Financial Report section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with
the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES
110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the
Code) that are relevant to my audit of the financial report in Australia. I have also fulfilled my
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.
The Audit Act 2008 further promotes the independence of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-
General is the auditor of all Tasmanian public sector entities and can only be removed by
Parliament. The Auditor-General may conduct an audit in any way considered appropriate
and is not subject to direction by any person about the way in which audit powers are to be
exercised. The Auditor-General has for the purposes of conducting an audit, access to all
documents and property and can report to Parliament matters which in the Auditor-
General’s opinion are significant.
My audit responsibility does not extend to the budget figures included in the financial
report, the asset renewal funding ratio disclosed in note 2.6f to the financial report and
accordingly, I express no opinion on them. Furthermore, I express no opinion on the General
Manager’s determination that Council did not have any Significant Business Activities for

                                                                                                     1

inclusion in the financial report as required by Section 84(2)(da) of the Local Government Act
1993.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for my opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgement, were of most
significance in my audit of the financial report of the current period. These matters were
addressed in the context of my audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming my
opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Responsibilities of the General Manager for the Financial Report
The General Manager is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial
report in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Local Government Act
1993 and for such internal control as determined necessary to enable the preparation of the
financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial report, the General Manager is responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Council is to be
dissolved by an Act of Parliament or the Councillors intend to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report
My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a
whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing
Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of this financial report.
As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, I exercise
professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:
    <U+F0B7>   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report,
        whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to
        those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
        basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
        from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
        collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
        internal control.
    <U+F0B7>   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
        audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
        of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
    <U+F0B7>   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
        accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the General Manager.
    <U+F0B7>   Conclude on the appropriateness of the General Manager’s use of the going concern
        basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
        uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on
        the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material
        uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the
        related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
        modify my opinion. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the
        date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the
        Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

                                                                                                   3

    <U+F0B7>   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report,
        including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represent the underlying
        transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
    <U+F0B7>   Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of
        the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the
        financial report. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
        the Group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.
I communicate with the General Manager regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.
From the matters communicated with the General Manager, I determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current period and are
therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare
circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public
interest benefits of such communication.

Notes to the Financial Report
for the year ended 30 June 2021

1     About the financial statements

      This section outlines the basis on which the Council's financial statements have been prepared including key judgements and
      estimates and any events which occurred subsequent to balance date that required reporting.

1.1   Reporting entity

       (a)       Southern Midlands Council is a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal. Council's main office is
                 located at 71 High Street, Oatlands.

      (b)      The purpose of the Council is to:
             o provide for health, safety and welfare of the community;
             o to improve the overall quality of life of people in the local community;

             o promote appropriate business and employment opportunities




1.2   Basis of accounting

      These financial statements are a general purpose financial report that consists of a Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive
      Income, Consolidated Financial Position, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows,
      and notes accompanying these financial statements. The general purpose financial report complies with Australian Accounting
      Standards, other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board, and the Local Government Act
      1993 (LGA1993) (as amended). Council has determined that it does not have profit generation as a prime objective.
      Consequently, where appropriate, Council has elected to apply options and exemptions within accounting standards that are
      applicable to not-for-profit entities. As a result this financial report does not comply with International Financial Reporting
      Standards.


      This financial report has been prepared on the accrual and going concern basis.

      All amounts are presented in Australian dollars and unless stated, have been rounded to the nearest thousand dollar.


      This financial report has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except where specifically stated.

      Unless otherwise stated, all accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the prior year. Where appropriate,
      comparative figures have been amended to accord with current presentation, and disclosure has been made of any material
      changes to comparatives.

      Special Committees of Council have been included in this financial report. Transactions betweeen these committees and Council
      have been eliminated in full.

      The financial report has been prepared as a consolidated report to include all the external transactions for the subsidiary entities
      disclosed at note 3.12. Council has elected not to present separate financial statements (Parent) in accordance with AASB 127
      Separate Financial Statements as the amounts involved are not considered material.




                                                                          Page 7

Notes to the Financial Report
for the year ended 30 June 2021

1.3   Use of judgements and estimates

      In the application of Australian Accounting Standards, Council is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about
      carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated
      assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
      circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements. Actual results may differ from these estimates.


      The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised
      in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future
      periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

      Council has made no assumptions concerning the future that may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
      and liabilities within the next reporting period. Judgements made by Council that have significant effects on the financial report
      are disclosed in the relevant notes as follows:

      Employee entitlements
      Assumptions are utilised in the determination of Council’s employee entitlement provisions. These assumptions are discussed in
      note 4.1.

      Defined benefit superannuation fund obligations
      Actuarial assumptions are utilised in the determination of Council’s defined benefit superannuation fund obligations. These
      assumptions are discussed in note 4.3.

      Fair value of property, plant, equipment and infrastructure
      Assumptions and judgements are utilised in determining the fair value of Council’s property, plant, equipment and infrastructure
      including useful lives and depreciation rates. These assumptions are discussed in note 3.6.

      Investment in water corporation
      Assumptions utilised in the determination of Council’s valuation of its investment in TasWater are discussed in note 3.5.

1.4   Events occurring after balance date

      No significant events occurred after balance date that require reporting.




                                                                        Page 8

       The Australian Government provides untied Financial Assistance Grants to Council for general purpose use and the provision of
       local roads. In accordance with AASB 1004 Contributions, Council recognised these grants as revenue when it received the funds
       and obtained control. In both years the Australian Government made early payment of the first two quarterly instalments for
       the following year. The early receipt of instalments resulted in Australian Government FInancial Assistance Grants being above
       that originally budgeted in 2020-21 by $1,808,000 (2019-20 by $1,840,000). This has impacted the Statement of Comprehensive
       Income resulting in the result from continuing operations being higher by the same amount.


       Unspent grants
       Grants which were obtained on the condition that they be spent for specified purposes or in a future period, but which are not
       yet spent in accordance with those conditions, are as follows

2.2k Recognition and measurement

       Rates and charges
       Council recognises revenue from rates and annual charges for the amount it is expected to be entitled to at the beginning of the
       rating period to which they relate, or when the charge has been applied. Rates and charges in advance are recognised as a
       financial liability until the beginning of the rating period to which they relate.

       User fees
       Council recognises revenue from user fees and charges when or as the performance obligation is completed and the customer
       receives the benefit of the goods / services being provided.

2.2   Income from continuing operations (continued)

      Grants - recurrent and capital
      Council recognises untied grant revenue and those without performance obligations when received. In cases where funding
      includes specific performance obligations or is to acquire or construct a recognisable non-financial asset, a liability is recognised
      for funds received in advance and recognises income as obligations are fulfilled.

      The performance obligations are varied based on the agreement, but include the approval to proceed and staged completion
      milestones during the construction phase of roads and other community infrastructure, such as the Oatlands Aquatic Centre.


      Each performance obligation is considered to ensure that the revenue recognition reflects the transfer of control and within
      grant agreements there may be some performance obligations where control transfers at a point in time and others which have
      continuous transfer of control over the life of the contract. Where control is transferred over time, generally the input methods
      being either costs or time incurred are deemed to be the most appropriate methods to reflect the transfer of benefit.


      For construction projects, this is generally as the construction progresses in accordance with costs incurred since this is deemed
      to be the most appropriate measure of the completeness of the construction project as there is no profit margin. For
      acquisitions of assets, the revenue is recognised when the asset is acquired and controlled by the Council.

      Interest
      Interest is recognised progressively as it is earned.

      Contract income
      As soon as the outcome of construction contracts can be estimated reliably, contract revenue and expenses are recognised in
      proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work
      performed. Any expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately.

      Other income
      Rental income
      Rents are recognised as revenue when the payment is due or the payment is received, whichever first occurs. Rental payments
      received in advance are recognised as a prepayment until they are due.
      Volunteer services
      Council recognises the inflow of resources in the form of volunteer services where the fair value of those services can be reliably
      measured and Council would have purchased those services if they had not been donated.
      Operating leases as lessor
      Council is a lessor and enters into agreements with a number of lessees. These include only non-commercial agreements.
      Where leases are non-commercial agreements, these are generally with not for profit, such as sporting, organisations. In these
      cases subsidised or peppercorn rents are charged because Council recognises part of its role is community service and
      community support. In these situations, Council records lease revenue on an accruals basis and records the associated
      properties as part of land and buildings within property, plant and equipment. Buildings are recognised at depreciated
      replacement cost.

2.2   Income from continuing operations (continued)

      Investment revenue from water corporation
      Dividend revenue is recognised when Council's right to receive payment is established and it can be reliably measured.

      Contributions
      Council recognises contributions without performance obligations when received. In cases where the contributions is for a
      specific purpose to acquire or construct a recognisable non-financial asset, a liability is recognised for funds received in advance
      and income recognised as obligations are fulfilled.

      Net gain/(loss) on disposal of property, plant, equipment and infrastructure
      The profit or loss on sale of an asset is determined when control of the asset has irrevocably passed to the buyer.

2.3g Recognition and measurement

       Expenses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income when a decrease in future economic benefits
       related to a decrease in asset or an increase of a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably. Further details of the nature
       and method of recognition and measurement of each expense item are set out below.


       Employee benefits
       Employee benefits include, where applicable, entitlements to wages and salaries, annual leave, sick leave, long service leave,
       superannuation and any other post-employment benefits. See also note 4.1.

       Materials and contracts
       Routine maintenance, repair costs, and minor renewal costs are expensed as incurred. Where the repair relates to the
       replacement of a component of an asset and the cost exceeds the capitalisation threshold the cost is capitalised and
       depreciated. The carrying value of the replaced asset is expensed.

       Depreciation and amortisation
       Buildings, land improvements, plant and equipment, infrastructure and other assets having limited useful lives are systematically
       depreciated over their useful lives to Council in a manner which reflects consumption of the service potential embodied in those
       assets. Estimates of remaining useful lives and residual values are made on a regular basis with major asset classes reassessed
       annually. Depreciation rates and methods are reviewed annually.

       Where assets have separate identifiable components that are subject to regular replacement, these components are assigned
       distinct useful lives and remaining values and a separate depreciation rate is determined for each component.




                                                                         Page 17

Notes to the Financial Report
for the year ended 30 June 2021

2.3   Expenses from continuing operations (continued)

      Land and road earthwork assets are not depreciated on the basis that they are assessed as not having a limited useful life. The
      non-depreciation of road earthwork assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period, to ensure that the accounting policy
      applied to particular earthwork assets reflects the most recent assessment of the useful lives of the assets, having regard to
      factors such as asset usage, physical deterioration and technical and commercial obsolescence.

      Major depreciation and amortisation periods used are listed below and are consistent with the prior year unless otherwise
      stated:

            * Recurrent income excludes income received specifically for new or upgraded assets, physical resources received free of
            charge or other income of a capital nature as set out below:

            Income from continuing operations                                        12,926         12,185

            The intent of the underlying result is to show the outcome of a council’s normal or usual day to day operations.

            The underlying surplus assesses overall financial operating effectiveness and Council has returned a small deficit in the
            current year and a surplus in the prior year. The 2019 result includes an impairment expense for remediation costs for a
            parcel of land and without these costs the underlying deficit would have been a small surplus. The negative result in 2018
            largely reflects the disposal of certain infrastructure and building assets during that year. The long term financial
            management plan aims to ensure a breakeven situation is maintained each financial year.


2.6b Underlying surplus or deficit ratio

            Underlying surplus or deficit                                                (35)          125         (258)          (509)
            Recurrent income*                                                        10,913         11,332      11,145         10,361

            This ratio serves as an overall measure of financial operating effectiveness.

             This measure shows whether Council's total liabilities can be met by its liquid assets. An excess of total liabilities over
             liquid assets means that, if all liabilities fell due at once, additional revenue would be needed to fund the shortfall. As
             noted liquid assets are substantially higher than total liabilities.

2.6d Net financial liabilities ratio

             Net financial liabilities                                                  9,877         10,529         10,867          10,907
             Recurrent income*                                                         10,913         11,332         11,145          10,361
             Net financial liabilities ratio %                       0% - (50%)         90.5%          92.9%          97.5%          105.3%

             This ratio indicates the net financial obligations of Council compared to its recurrent income. This ratio is well in excess of
             benchmark and indicates a strong liquidity position.

2.6e Asset consumption ratio

             An asset consumption ratio has been calculated in relation to each asset class required to be included in the long-term

             An asset consumption ratio has been calculated in relation to each asset class required to be included in council's long
             term strategic asset management plan.

             The ratios assess the level of service potential in council's existing assets. The higher the percentage, the greater future
             service potential is available to provide service to ratepayers. The percentage results indicate that council must increase
             its investment in the renewal and replacement of existing assets. This is recognised in council's long term financial
             management strategy and plan.

             The asset renewal funding ratio is issued to assess council's capacity to fund future asset replacement requirements. This
             is in line with Council's long term financial management strategy and associated financial plan.

             The asset sustainability ratio assesses the extent to which council is maintaining operating capacity through renewal of its
             existing asset base. Whilst results may be below the nominated benchmark, it needs to be recognised that the actual
             need to expend funds on the renewal or replacement of assets can fluctuate substantially from year to year, whilst annual
             depreciation is fairly constant.

Notes to the Financial Report
for the year ended 30 June 2021

3.2   Trade and other receivables (continued)

      Recognition and measurement
      Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at amortised cost, which represents their
      transaction value. Impairment is recognised on an expected credit loss (ECL) basis. When determining whether the credit risk
      has increased significantly since initial recognition, and when estimating the ECL, Council considers reasonable and supportable
      information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative
      information and analysis based on Council’s historical experience, an informed credit assessment and forward-looking
      information. Council has established a provision matrix to facilitate the impairment assessment.

      For rate debtors, Council takes the view that unpaid rates represent a charge against the rateable property that will be
      recovered when the property is next sold. For non-rate debtors, Council uses the presumptions that assets more than 30 days
      past due have a significant increase in credit risk and those more than 90 days will likely be in default. Council writes off
      receivables when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect
      of recovery.



3.3   Assets held for sale

      Recognition and measurement
      A non-current asset held for sale (including disposal groups) is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less
      costs to sell, and is not subject to depreciation. Non-current assets, disposal groups and related liabilities are treated as current
      and classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through
      continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset's sale (or disposal group
      sale) is expected to be completed within 12 months from the date of classification.

      Recognition and measurement
      As Council's investment in TasWater is held for long-term strategic purposes, Council has elected under AASB 9: Financial
      Instruments to irrevocably classify this equity investment as designated as fair value through other comprehensive income.
      Subsequent changes in fair value on designated investments in equity instruments are recognised in other comprehensive
      income (for fair value reserve, refer note 6.1) and not reclassified through the profit or loss when derecognised. Dividends
      associated with the equity investments are recognised in profit and loss when the right of payment has been established and it
      can be reliably measured. Fair value was determined by using Council's ownership interest against TasWater's net asset value at
      balance date. At 30 June 2021, Council held a 0.72% ownership interest in TasWater (2020: 0.72%) which is based on Schedule
      2 of the Corporation's Constitution which reflects the Council's voting rights.

      Recognition and measurement
      Acquisitions of assets are initially recorded at cost. Cost is determined as the fair value of the assets given as consideration plus
      costs incidental to the acquisition. Property, infrastructure, plant and equipment received in the form of contributions, are
      recognised as assets and revenues at fair value by Council valuation where that value exceeds the recognition thresholds for the
      respective asset class. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market
      participants at the measurement date. Where assets are constructed by Council, cost includes all materials used in construction,
      direct labour, borrowing costs incurred during construction, and an appropriate share of directly attributable variable and fixed
      overheads.

      The following classes of assets have been recognised. In accordance with Council's policy, the threshold limits detailed below
      have applied when recognising assets within an applicable asset class and unless otherwise stated are consistent with the prior
      year. Council has adopted the following valuation bases for each asset class.

      Subsequent to the initial recognition of assets, non-current physical assets, other than those noted above, are measured at their
      fair value in accordance with AASB 116 Property, Plant & Equipment and AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement. At balance date,
      Council reviewed the carrying value of the individual classes of assets measured at fair value to ensure that each asset class
      materially approximated its fair value. Where the carrying value materially differed from the fair value at balance date the class
      of asset was revalued.


      In addition, Council undertakes a formal revaluation of land, buildings, and infrastructure assets on a regular basis to ensure
      valuations represent fair value. The valuation is performed either by experienced Council officers or independent experts.


      Fair value valuations are determined in accordance with a valuation hierarchy. Changes to the valuation hierarchy will only
      occur if an external change in the restrictions or limitations of use on an asset result in changes to the permissible or practical
      highest and best use of the asset.

      Where the assets are revalued, the revaluation increments are credited directly to the asset revaluation reserve except to the
      extent that an increment reverses a prior year decrement for that class of asset that had been recognised as an expense in which
      case the increment is recognised as revenue up to the amount of the expense. Revaluation decrements are recognised as an
      expense except where prior increments are included in the asset revaluation surplus for that class of asset in which case the
      decrement is taken to the reserve to the extent of the remaining increments. Within the same class of assets, revaluation
      increments and decrements within the year are offset.


      Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income under other expenses.

3.7   Right of use assets

      Council had no non-concessionary leases during the year and has not recognised any associated right of use assets or lease
      liabilities at a balance date.

      Concessionary leases
      Council has 3 concessionary leases with the Crown in Right of Tasmania for land and buildings within the municipality. Council
      uses these leased assets for community facilities, public recreation and the provision of infrastructure. Council is dependent on
      these leases to further its objectives. The consideration paid for each of these leases is "peppercorn", with lease fees of $1 per
      annum if demanded, over lease terms of between 10 and 40 years. The lease liability for these leases is immaterial and, in
      accordance with Council's accounting policy to measure right of use assets arising from concessionary leases at the initial
      measurement of the lease liability, the right of use assets are also immaterial and have not been recognised.


      Recognition and measurement
      Council as lessee
      In contracts where Council is a lessee, Council recognises a right of use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of
      the lease, unless the short term or low value exemption is applied.

      A right of use asset is initially measured at cost comprising the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease
      payments made before the commencement date (reduced by lease incentives received), plus initial direct costs incurred in
      obtaining the lease and an estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site
      on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease.

      Where right of use assets are recognised they are measured as described in the accounting policy for property, infrastructure,
      plant and equipment in note 3.6. Also, Council will apply AASB 136 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and
      accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the aforesaid note.

      Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease
      transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a
      purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts
      at the commencement date of the lease.


      Concessionary leases
      For leases that have significantly below market terms and conditions principally to enable the Council to further its objectives,
      commonly known as "peppercorn (concessionary) leases", Council has elected to measure a class (or classes) of right-of-use
      assets arising under 'concessionary leases' at initial recognition at cost, in accordance with AASB16.23–25. Cost being the initial
      measurement of the lease liability.

      Recognition and measurement
      Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods and services provided to Council as at balance date
      whether or not invoices have been received. General Creditors are unsecured, not subject to interest charges and are normally
      settled within 30 days of invoice receipt. Rates and charges in advance represents amounts received by Council prior to the
      commencement of the rating or charging period. Revenue is recognised by Council at the beginning of the rating or charge
      period to which the advance payment relates.

      Recognition and measurement
      Amounts received as tender deposits and retention amounts controlled by Council are recognised as trust funds until they are
      returned or forfeited.

      Recognition and measurement
      Grants received but unspent to construct Council controlled assets represent funding for construction projects for community
      infrastructure. The funds received are under enforceable contracts which require Council to perform specific obligations to
      construct identified assets for the community infrastructure projects which will be under Council’s control on completion. The
      revenue is recognised as Council constructs the assets and the contract liability reflects the funding received which cannot yet be
      recognised as revenue. Revenue is expected to be recognised in the next 12 months.

3.11 Fair value measurements

     Council measures and recognises the following assets at fair value on a recurring basis:
          Investment in water corporation as disclosed at note 3.5
          Property and infrastructure as disclosed at note 3.6

     Council does not measure any liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis.

     Council also has assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as a result of being reclassified as assets held for sale.
     These comprise land as disclosed in note 3.3. A description of the valuation techniques and the inputs used to determine the
     fair value of this land is included below under the heading 'Assets held for sale'.

     (a)   Fair Value Hierarchy

     AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires all assets and liabilities measured at fair value to be assigned to a level in the fair
     value hierarchy as follows:
           Level 1               Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can
                                 access at the measurement date.
           Level 2                 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
                                   either directly or indirectly.
           Level 3                 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

     The table below shows the assigned level for each asset and liability held at fair value by the Council. The table presents the
     Council's assets and liabilities measured and recognised at fair value at balance date.

     The fair values of the assets are determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable data, where it is
     available, and minimise the use of entity specific estimates. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable
     market data, the asset is included in level 3. This is the case for Council infrastructure assets, which are of a specialist nature for
     which there is no active market for similar or identical assets. These assets are valued using a combination of observable and
     unobservable inputs.




                                                                         Page 32

      Transfers between levels of the hierarchy
      Council's policy is to recognise transfers in and out of the fair value hierarchy levels as at the end of the reporting period. With
      exception of the transfer of $100,000 from land (level 2) to assets held for sale (level 1), there were no transfers between levels
      1 and 2 during the year, nor between levels 2 and 3.

      (b)    Highest and best use

      AASB 13 requires the fair value of non-financial assets to be calculated based on their "highest and best use". Council considers
      that all assets in this note are being used for their highest and best use.

      (c)    Valuation techniques and significant inputs used to derive fair values

      Investment in water corporation
      Refer to 3.5 for details of valuation techniques used to derive fair values.

      Land
      Land fair values were determined by a qualified independent valuer. Level 2 valuation inputs were used to value land in freehold
      title as well as land used for special purposes, which is restricted in use under current planning provisions. Sales prices of
      comparable land sites in close proximity are adjusted for differences in key attributes such as property size. The most significant
      input into this valuation approach is price per square metre.

Notes to the Financial Report
for the year ended 30 June 2021

3.11 Fair value measurements (continued)

     Land held for sale
     Land classified as held for sale during the reporting period was measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less
     cost to sell at the time of reclassification. The fair value of the land was determined using the approach described in the
     preceding paragraph.

     Land under roads
     Land under roads valuation is based on an avereage per square metre property rates supplied by the Tasmanian Valuer General.


     Buildings
     Council considers that all its buildings are of a specialist nature (eg heritage buildings) and there is no active market for the
     assets. Fair value has been determined on the basis of replacement with a new asset having similar service potential. The gross
     current values have been determined by Council officers with reference to market data for recent projects and costing guides.


     In determining the level of accumulated depreciation the asset has been disaggregated into significant components which
     exhibit useful lives. Allowance has been made for the typical asset life cycle and renewal treatments of each component,
     residual value at the time the asset is considered to be no longer available for use.

     While the unit rates based on square metres can be supported by market evidence (level 2), the estimates of residual value and
     useful life that are used to calculate accumulated depreciation comprise unobservable inputs (level 3).

     Infrastructure assets
     All Council infrastructure assets were fair valued using written down current replacement cost (CRC). This valuation comprises
     the asset's gross replacement cost less accumulated depreciation calculated on the basis of such cost to reflect the already
     consumed or expired future economic benefits of the asset. Council first determined the gross cost of replacing the full service
     potential of the asset and then adjusted this amount to take account of the expired service potential of the asset.

     CRC was measured by reference to the lowest cost at which the gross future economic benefits of the asset could currently be
     obtained in the normal course of business. The resulting valuation reflects the cost of replacing the existing economic benefits
     based on an efficient set of modern equivalent assets to achieve the required level of service output.


     The unit rates (labour and materials) and quantities applied to determine the CRC of an asset or asset component were based on
     a "Greenfield" assumption meaning that the CRC was determined as the full cost of replacement with a new asset including
     components that may not need to be replaced, such as earthworks.

     The level of accumulated depreciation for infrastructure assets was determined based on the age of the asset and the useful life
     adopted by Council for the asset type. Estimated useful lives and residual values are disclosed in Note 2.3.

     The calculation of CRC involves a number of inputs that require judgement and are therefore classed as unobservable. While
     these judgements are made by qualified and experienced staff, different judgements could result in a different valuation.


     The methods for calculating CRC are described under individual asset categories below.

     Roads
     Council categorises its road infrastructure into sealed and unsealed roads and then further sub-categorises these based on an
     assessment of vehicle movements and social and economic importance. Roads are managed in segments. All road segments are
     then componentised into formation, pavement, sub-pavement and seal (where applicable). Council assumes that environmental
     factors such as soil type, climate and topography are consistent across each segment. Council also assumes a segment is
     designed and constructed to the same standard and uses a consistent amount of labour and materials.




                                                                      Page 34

Notes to the Financial Report
for the year ended 30 June 2021

3.11 Fair value measurements (continued)

     CRC is based on the road area multiplied by a unit price; the unit price being an estimate of labour and material inputs, services
     costs, and overhead allocations. For internal construction estimates, material and services prices are based on contract rates,
     supplier price lists and Council's labour wage rates. When construction is outsourced, CRC is based on the average of similar
     completed projects over the last few years.

     Bridges
     Council engaged an external expert to undertake valuation of bridges. Each bridge is assessed individually and componentised
     into sub-assets representing the deck and sub-structure. The valuation is based on the material type used for construction and
     the deck and sub-structure area.

     Stormwater
     Council engaged the Brighton Council Municipal Engineer to undertake the valuation of stormwater. Similar to roads,
     stormwater assets are managed in segments; pits and pipes being the major components. Consistent with roads, Council
     assumes that environmental factors such as soil type, climate and topography are consistent across each segment and that a
     segment is designed and constructed to the same standard and uses a consistent amount of labour and materials. CRC is based
     on the unit price for the component type. For pipes, the unit price is multiplied by the asset's length. The unit price for pipes is
     based on the construction material as well as the depth the pipe is laid.


     Other Infrastructure
     Other infrastructure is not deemed to be significant in terms of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

     (d)   Changes in recurring level 3 fair value measurements

     The changes in level 3 property and infrastructure assets with recurring fair value measurements are detailed in note 3.6
     (Property, plant, equipment and infrastructure). Investment in water corporation, which is classified as level 3 has been
     separately disclosed in note 3.5.

     There have been no transfers between level 1, 2 or 3 measurements during the year.

     (e)   Valuation processes

     At the end of each year Council assess whether the carrying amount of its assets varies significantly from the fair value. This is
     done by consideration of changes in utlisation, obsolesence, assessment of unit rates, patterns of consumption, residual life,
     useful life, condition and remaining useful life.

     Based on this assessment assets may need to be revalued and/or depreciation rates changed.

     (f)   Assets and liabilities not measured at fair value but for which fair value is disclosed

     Council has assets and liabilities which are not measured at fair value, but for which fair values are disclosed in other notes.

     Council borrowings are measured at amortised cost with interest recognised in profit or loss when incurred. The fair value of
     borrowings disclosed in note 5.3 is provided by Tascorp (level 2).

     The carrying amounts of trade receivables and trade payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short-
     term nature (level 2).

      Recognition and measurement

      Short term obligations
      Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and accumulating sick leave expected to be
      wholly settled within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised in
      respect of employees' services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid
      when the liabilities are settled. The liability for annual leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits. All other short-
      term employee benefit obligations are presented as payables.


      Other long term employee benefit obligations
      The liability for long service leave and annual leave which is not expected to be wholly settled within 12 months after the end of
      the period in which the employees render the related service is recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured
      as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the
      reporting period using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels,
      experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the
      end of the reporting period on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as
      possible, the estimated future cash outflows.


      The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the statement of financial position if the entity does not have an
      unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, regardless of when the actual
      settlement is expected to occur.

      Personal leave
      Council's Enterprise Bargaining Agreement provides for employees who resign from their position with Council to be paid a
      percentage of their sick leave balance based on completed years of service, plus a gratuity amount.

4.2   Related party transactions (continued)

      Directors of subsidiary companies remuneration

      Two directors of Heritage Building Solutions Pty Ltd and Heritage Education & Skills Centre Pty Ltd were paid directors and
      management fees in total of $38,442 (2020: $38,694).

      Remuneration Principles

      Councillors
      Councillor allowances are paid in accordance with those set by Regulation 42 (2) of the Local Government General Regulations
      2015. Council has further determined by policy that in order to carry out their functions as a Councillor, reimbursements will be
      paid to Councillors for travelling while on Council related business on a kilometre travelled basis, that stationery and
      consumables will be provided and that a communications allowance will be paid to offset the cost of telephone and internet
      charges.


      Senior management
      The employment terms and conditions of senior executives are contained in individual employment contracts and prescribe
      total remuneration, superannuation, annual and long service leave, vehicle and salary sacrifice provisions. In addition to their
      salaries, Council also provides non-cash benefits and contributes to post-employment superannuation plans on their behalf.


      The performance of each senior manager, including the General Manager, is reviewed annually which includes a review of their
      remuneration package, which takes account of their performance against key indicators and of salary packages for similar roles
      in the region. Whilst not automatic, contracts can be extended.

      Directors of subisdiary companies
      Directors of Heritage Building Solutions Pty Ltd and Heritage Education & Skills Centre Pty Ltd are remunerated in accordance
      with the terms and conditions of their appointment and may be varied in accordance with the consitution of each company and
      the Corporations Act 2001.

      Transactions with related parties
      During the period Council did not enter into transactions with entities that are controlled by members of key management
      personnel.

      In accordance with s84(2)(b) of the Local Government Act 1993, no interests have been notified to the General Manager in
      respect of any body or organisation with which the Council has major financial dealings.

      Transactions with related parties that have not been disclosed
      Most of the entities and people that are related parties of Council live and operate within the municipality. Therefore, on a
      regular basis ordinary citizen transactions occur between Council and its related parties. Some examples include:
      - Payment of rates on a primary residence
      - Dog registration
      Council has not included these types of transaction in its disclosure, where they are made on the same terms and conditions
      available to the general public.

4.3   Post employment benefits

      Recognition and measurement

      Defined contribution funds
      Council contributes to defined contribution plans on behalf of a number of employees; however the Council has no ongoing
      responsibility to make good any deficiencies, if any, that may occur in those schemes. Contributions to defined contribution
      plans are recognised as an expense as they become payable. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that
      a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.


      Defined benefit fund
      A liability or asset in respect of defined benefit superannuation plans would ordinarily be recognised in the statement of
      financial position, and measured as the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date plus unrecognised
      actuarial gains (less unrecognised actuarial losses) less the fair value of the superannuation fund’s assets at that date and any
      unrecognised past service cost. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is based on expected future payments which
      arise from membership of the fund to the reporting date, calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit
      credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods
      of service. However, when this information is not reliably available, Council accounts for its obligations to defined benefit plans
      on the same basis as its obligations to defined contribution plans i.e as an expense when it becomes payable.

      Council makes superannuation contributions for a number of its employees to the Quadrant Defined Benefits Fund (the Fund), a
      sub-fund of the Tasplan Superannuation Fund (Tasplan). The Quadrant Defined Benefits Fund has been classified as a multi-
      employer sponsored plan. As the Fund’s assets and liabilities are pooled and are not allocated by employer, the Actuary is
      unable to allocate benefit liabilities, assets and costs between employers. As provided under paragraph 34 of AASB 119
      Employee Benefits, Council does not use defined benefit accounting for these contributions.

      For the year ended 30 June 2021 the Council contributed 3% of employees’ gross income to the Fund. Assets accumulate in the
      fund to meet member benefits as they accrue, and if assets within the fund are insufficient to satisfy benefits payable, the
      Council is required to meet its share of the deficiency.

      Rice Warner Pty Ltd undertook the last actuarial review of the Fund at 30 June 2020. The review disclosed that at that time the
      net market value of assets available for funding member benefits was $51,939,000, the value of vested benefits was
      $43,411,000, the surplus over vested benefits was $8,528,000, the value of total accrued benefits was $43,562,000, and the
      number of members was 95. These amounts relate to all members of the Fund at the date of valuation and no asset or liability
      is recorded in the Tasplan Super’s financial statements for Council employees.


      The financial assumptions used to calculate the Accrued Benefits for the Fund were:
          n Net Investment Return 3.75% p.a.
          n Salary Inflation 2.75% p.a.
          n Price Inflation n/a

4.3   Post employment benefits (continued)

      The actuarial review concluded that:


          n
              The value of assets of the Fund was adequate to meet the liabilities of the Fund in respect of vested benefits as at 30 June
              2020.
          n
              The value of assets of the Fund was adequate to meet the value of the liabilities of the Fund in respect of accrued benefits
              as at 30 June 2020.

          n
              Based on the assumptions used, and assuming the Employer contributes at the levels described below, the value of the
              assets is expected to continue to be adequate to meet the value of the liabilities of the Fund in respect of vested benefits
              at all times during the period up to 30 June 2020.

      Given the strong financial position of the Fund, the Actuary recommended that the Council consider a contribution holiday and
      contribute 0% of salaries from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2024. The Actuary will continue to undertake a brief review of the
      financial position the Fund at the end of each financial year to confirm that the contribution rates remain appropriate. The next
      full triennial actuarial review of the Fund will have an effective date of 30 June 2023 and is expected to be completed late in
      2023.

      As required in terms of paragraph 148 of AASB 119 Employee Benefits, Council discloses the following details:

          n
              The 2020 actuarial review used the “aggregate” funding method. This is a standard actuarial funding method. The results
              from this method were tested by projecting future fund assets and liabilities for a range of future assumed investment
              returns. The funding method used is consistent with the method used at the previous actuarial review in 2017.

              Under the aggregate funding method of financing the benefits, the stability of the Councils’ contributions over time
              depends on how closely the Fund’s actual experience matches the expected experience. If the actual experience differs
              from that expected, the Councils’ contribution rate may need to be adjusted accordingly to ensure the Fund remains on
              course towards financing members’ benefits.
          n
              In terms of Rule 27.4 of the Tasplan Trust Deed (Trust Deed), there is a risk that employers within the Fund may incur an
              additional liability when an Employer ceases to participate in the Fund at a time when the assets of the Fund are less than
              members’ vested benefits. Each member of the Fund who is an employee of the Employer who is ceasing to Participate is
              required to be provided with a benefit at least equal to their vested benefit in terms of Rule 27.4 (b) (A). However there is
              no provision in the Trust Deed requiring an employer to make contributions other than its regular contributions up to the
              date of cessation of contributions. This issue can be resolved by the Trustee seeking an Actuarial Certificate in terms of
              Rule 26.5 identifying a deficit and the Trustee determining in terms of Rule 26.3(c) that the particular employer should
              make the payment required to make good any shortfall before the cessation of participation is approved.

          n
              The application of Fund assets on Tasplan being wound-up is set out in Rule 41.4. This Rule provides that expenses and
              taxation liabilities should have first call on the available assets. Additional assets will initially be applied for the benefit of
              the then remaining members and/or their Dependants in such manner as the Trustee considers equitable and appropriate
              in accordance with the Applicable Requirements (broadly, superannuation and taxation legislative requirements and
              other requirements as determined by the regulators).
              The Trust Deed does not contemplate the Fund withdrawing from Tasplan. However it is likely that Rule 27.4 would be
              applied in this case (as detailed above).




                                                                           Page 43

         n
             The Fund is a defined benefit Fund.

         n
           The Quadrant Defined Benefits Fund has been classified as a multi-employer sponsored plan. As the Fund’s assets and
           liabilities are pooled and are not allocated by employer, the Actuary is unable to allocate benefit liabilities, assets and
           costs between employers. Thus the Fund is not able to prepare standard AASB119 defined benefit reporting.
         n
           As reported above, Assets exceeded accrued benefits as at the date of the last actuarial review, 30 June 2020. Moderate
           investment returns, since that date, make it quite probable that this is still the position. The financial position of the Fund
           will be fully investigated at the actuarial review as at 30 June 2023.

         n
             An analysis of the assets and vested benefits of sub-funds participating in the Scheme, prepared by Rice Warner Pty Ltd as
             at 30 June 2020, showed that the Fund had assets of $51.94 million and members’ Vested Benefits were $43.41 million.
             These amounts represented 0.53% and 0.45% respectively of the corresponding total amounts for Tasplan.

         n
           As at 30 June 2020 the Fund had 95 members and the total employer contributions and member contributions for the
           year ending 30 June 2020 were $927,231 and $235,365 respectively.
         n
           During the reporting period the amount of contributions paid to defined benefits schemes was $4,810 (2019-20, $4,681),
           and the amount paid to accumulation schemes was $378,526 (2019-20, $323,399).
         n
           During the next reporting period the expected amount of contributions to be paid to defined benefits schemes is $4,900,
           and the amount to be paid to accumulation schemes is $388,000.

5     Debt and risk management

      This section sets out the interest bearing debts of Council and outlines Council's exposure to financial risks and how these risks
      are managed.

5.1   Interest-bearing loans and borrowings

(Amounts shown in $000)                                                                                                2021           2020

      Current
      Borrowings - secured                                                                                             334             73

      Non-current
      Borrowings - secured                                                                                           4,415            384

      Total borrowings                                                                                               4,749            457

      Borrowings are secured over the rate income of Council. There have been no defaults or breaches of the loan agreement during
      the year.

      The maturity profile for Council's borrowings is:


      Not later than one year                                                                                          334             73
      Later than one year and not later than five years                                                              4,415            275
      Later than five years                                                                                              -            109
      Total                                                                                                          4,749            457

      Recognition and measurement
      The borrowing capacity of Council is limited by the Local Government Act 1993. Interest bearing liabilities are initially recognised
      at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition these liabilities are measured at amortised cost.
      Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the Consolidated
      Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period of the liability using the effective interest method.

      Credit risk

      The maximum exposure to credit risk at balance date in relation to each class of recognised financial asset is represented by the
      carrying amount of those assets as indicated in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

      Risks and mitigation

      The risks associated with our main financial instruments and our policies for minimising these risks are detailed below.


      Market risk
      Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of our financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in
      market prices. Council's exposures to market risk are primarily through interest rate risk with only insignificant exposure to other
      price risks and no exposure to foreign currency risk. Components of market risk to which we are exposed are discussed below.


      Interest rate risk
      Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument will
      fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from interest bearing financial assets and liabilities
      that we use. Non derivative interest bearing assets are predominantly short term liquid assets. Our interest rate liability risk
      arises primarily from long term loans and borrowings at fixed rates which exposes us to fair value interest rate risk.


      Our loan borrowings are sourced from major Australian banks by a tender process. Finance leases are sourced from major
      Australian financial institutions. Overdrafts are arranged with major Australian banks. We manage interest rate risk on our net
      debt portfolio by:
      - ensuring access to diverse sources of funding;
      - reducing risks of refinancing by managing in accordance with target maturity profiles; and
      - setting prudential limits on interest repayments as a percentage of rate revenue.

      We manage the interest rate exposure on our debt portfolio by appropriate budgeting strategies and obtaining approval for
      borrowings from the Department of Treasury and Finance each year.



                                                                         Page 48

Southern Midlands Council                                                                      Financial Report                     2020|21

Notes to the Financial Report
for the year ended 30 June 2021

5.3   Financial Instruments (continued)

      Investment of surplus funds is made with approved financial institutions under the Local Government Act 1993. We manage
      interest rate risk by adopting an investment policy that ensures:
       - conformity with State and Federal regulations and standards,
       - capital protection,
       - appropriate liquidity,
       - diversification by credit rating, financial institution and investment product,
       - monitoring of return on investment,
       - benchmarking of returns and comparison with budget.

      Maturity will be staggered to provide for interest rate variations and to minimise interest rate risk.

      Credit risk
      Credit risk is the risk that a contracting entity will not complete its obligations under a financial instrument and cause Council to
      make a financial loss. Council have exposure to credit risk on some financial assets included in our Consolidated Statement of
      Financial Position. To help manage this risk:
      - we have a policy for establishing credit limits for the entities we deal with;
      - we may require collateral where appropriate; and
      - we only invest surplus funds with financial institutions which have a recognised credit rating specified in our Investment policy.

      Credit risk arises from Council's financial assets, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, and trade and other receivables.
      Council's exposure to credit risk arises from potential default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the
      carrying amount of these instruments. Exposure at balance date is addressed in each applicable policy note. Council generally
      trades with recognised, creditworthy third parties, and as such collateral is generally not requested, nor is it Council's policy to
      securitise its trade and other receivables.

      It is Council's policy that some customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures
      including an assessment of their credit rating, financial position, past experience and industry reputation.
      In addition, receivable balance are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that Council's exposure to bad debts is not
      significant.


      Ageing of Trade and Other Receivables
      At balance date other debtors representing financial assets were past due but not impaired. These amounts relate to a number
      of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default. The ageing of the Council's Trade and Other
      Receivables was:

      Liquidity risk
      Liquidity risk includes the risk that, as a result of our operational liquidity requirements:
       - we will not have sufficient funds to settle a transaction on the date;
       - we will be forced to sell financial assets at a value which is less than what they are worth; or
       - we may be unable to settle or recover a financial assets at all.

      To help reduce these risks we:
       - have a liquidity policy which targets a minimum and average level of cash and cash equivalents to be maintained;
       - have readily accessible standby facilities and other funding arrangements in place;
       - monitor budget to actual performance on a regular basis; and
       - set limits on borrowings relating to the percentage of loans to rate revenue and percentage of loan principal repayments to
      rate revenue.

      The Council's exposure to liquidity risk is deemed insignificant based on prior periods' data and current assessment of risk.

5.3   Financial Instruments (continued)

      Sensitivity disclosure analysis

      Taking into account past performance, future expectations, economic forecasts, and management's knowledge and experience
      of the financial markets, the Council believes the following movements are 'reasonably possible' over the next 12 months (Base
      rates are sourced from Reserve Bank of Australia):
       - A parallel shift of + 1% and -0.5% in market interest rates (AUD) from year-end rates.

      The table below discloses the impact on net operating result and equity for each category of financial instruments held by
      Council at year-end, if the above movements were to occur.

      Recognition and measurement

      The asset revaluation reserve was established to capture the movements in asset valuations upon the periodic revaluation of
      Council's assets.

      Council has to designate its investment in Taswater as an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income.
      Subsequent changes in fair value are reflected in the reserve and will not be reclassified through the profit or loss when
      derecognised. This equity Investment asset within the fair value reserve was previously classified as an available for sale asset.


      The available-for-sale financial asset reserve was established to capture the fair value movements in Council's Water
      Corporation investment.

      Other reserves have been created at the discretion of Council to capture allocations for specific purposes.

6.2   Prior period error

      In undertaking a revaluation of land and buildings for the 2020-21 financial statements, Council identified land and buildings
      which were not included in the 2018-19 and prior years financial statements. The fair value of the assets not taken up was
      $2,015,000, comprising land of $490,000 and buildings of $1,525,000. In order to correct this error an adjustment has been
      made to opening accumulated surplus as at 1 July 2019 of $2,015,000.

      Comparative numbers reported in the 2019-20 statement of financial position, and at the beginning of the comparative financial
      year (1 July 2019), have been restated to corrrect this error. The line items affected are as follows:

      against Council.

      Recognition and measurement

      Contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, but are
      disclosed by way of note and, if quantifiable, are measured at nominal value. Contingent assets and liabilities are presented
      inclusive of GST receivable or payable respectively.

6.5   Other significant accounting policies and new accounting standards

      (a)   Taxation

            Council is exempt from all forms of taxation except Fringe Benefits Tax, Payroll Tax and the Goods and Services Tax.

            Goods and services tax (GST)
            Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST incurred is not
            recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office. In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the cost of
            acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the expense. Receivables and payables in the balance sheet are shown
            inclusive of GST.

            Cash flows are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis, except for the GST component of
            investing and financing activities, which are disclosed as operating cash flows.

      (b)   Allocation between current and non-current

            In the determination of whether an asset or liability is current or non-current, consideration is given to the time when
            each asset or liability is expected to be settled. The asset or liability is classified as current if it is expected to be settled
            within the next twelve months, being Council's operational cycle, or if Council does not have an unconditional right to
            defer settlement of a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.

      (c)   Budget

            The estimated revenue and expense amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income represent revised
            budget amounts and are not audited.

6.5   Other significant accounting policies and new accounting standards (continued)

      (d)       Adoption of new and amended accounting standards

                In the current year, Council has adopted all of the new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian
                Accounting Standards Board that are relevant to its operations and effective for the current annual reporting period, as
                follows:


            n
                AASB 2018-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Definition of Material
                 The amendments refine the definition of material in AASB 101 and are applicable for the year ended 30 June 2021. The
                 amendments clarify the definition of material and includes guidance relating to obscuring information that could be
                 reasonably expected to influence decisions of the primary users of the financial information. The amendments include
                 additional guidance to the definition of material, gives it more prominence, and clarifies the explanation accompanying
                 the definition of material. The adoption of the amendments has not had any significant impact on Council.


      (e)       Pending Accounting Standards

                Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the 30 June 2021
                reporting period. Council's assessment of the impact of the relevant new standards and interpretations is set out below.


            n
                AASB 2017-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Effective Date of Amendments to AASB 10 and AASB 128
                and Editorial Correction, applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022.
                  The amendments address an acknowledge inconsistency between the requirements in AASB10, and those in AASB128
                  (2011) in dealing with the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture.

                 The main consequence of the amendments is that a full gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves a business
                 (whether it is housed in a subsidiary or not). A partial gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves assets that
                 do not constitute a business, even if these assets are housed in a subsidiary. Council does not anticipate this standard
                 having any material impact.
