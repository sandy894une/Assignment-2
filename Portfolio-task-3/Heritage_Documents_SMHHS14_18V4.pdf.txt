    Southern Midlands Council Historic Heritage Strategy 2014-2018



                                        Under the Historic Cultural Heritage Act 1995, The Tasmanian
                                        Heritage Council (THC) are a referral body for applications
                                        for works on places listed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register
                                        (THR). Planning Authorities manage the application process
                                        and must include THC conditions, advice or refusals on a
                                        planning permit for works to listed places.

                                        Council manages the heritage values of places listed solely
                                        on Schedule 4 (Heritage) of the Southern Midlands Planning
                                        Scheme 1998 (the scheme) and Part 10 of the scheme
                                        establishes provisions listing the matters which Council must

                                  Southern Midlands Council Historic Heritage Strategy 2014-2018


Heritage areas
Clause 9.1 of the scheme details special planning provisions
for properties within Historic Precinct Special Areas (HPSA).
These are designated areas within the centre of Oatlands,
Kempton and Campania, as well as the ‘Heritage Mile’ at
Mangalore, which contain a high concentration of Schedule
4 places. Akin to ‘desired future character statements’,
these provisions give guidelines as to allowable development
within these areas as a means of maintaining (in addition to           Lost Heritage
heritage fabric) the overall character of these precincts.
Many of these provisions override standard permitted uses
and trigger a discretionary planning approvals process.
These areas have been reviewed, and others added which
form part of the draft planning scheme.

Some years ago, council’s Municipal Architect developed
‘Design Guidelines for Georgian Buildings in the Main Street
of Kempton & Oatlands’. Whilst this has no statutory standing,
this is used as a consistent benchmark for the assessment of
development within those areas. The guidelines provide a
practical interpretation and elaboration of the Planning
Scheme provisions, as they should generally be applied to
Kempton and Oatlands. Council is currently drafting new
guidelines, in tandem with amending its current planning
scheme in respect of revised HPSA’s (refer below).



 Proposed expanded and new Heritage Areas
 In 2014 Council has pursued a number of amendments to its current planning scheme (the
 Southern Midlands Planning Scheme 1998) in regard to heritage precincts. These are:
     <U+F0B7> Tailoring the heritage precinct provisions at Oatlands to specifically refer to its
        predominant Georgian character.
     <U+F0B7> Expanding the Oatlands precinct.
     <U+F0B7> Identifying that portion of the precinct around Callington Mill as a specific precinct.
     <U+F0B7> Expanding the landscape protection special area previously extending 100 metres from
        the highway to cover most of the rural land between the highway and the town.
     <U+F0B7> Expanding the heritage precinct at Campania.
     <U+F0B7> Reducing the heritage precinct at Kempton, slightly.
     <U+F0B7> Creating a new landscape precinct at Colebrook on the hill face that forms and
        important backdrop to the Pugin designed St Patrick’s Church.




                                                                                                   7

archaeological artifact laboratory and store.  An interpretation plan has been partially
implemented and the building is near-ready for public access as guided by the Oatlands
Gaol Use and Development Plan. The building is utilised as part of Arts Tasmania’s Artist in
Residence program.

Whilst the gaol yard still houses the swimming pool, approximately 1/3 of the yard has been
reclaimed as part of the historic site and basic landscaping and interpretation has been
installed. The gaol arch, which was moved to High Street in 1939, has been reinstated in its
original location at the front of the gaol complex. The yard is envisaged to be used as freely
accessible public space, supplementing use of the building.

Further to the recommendations of the Oatlands Gaol Use and Development Plan, there is a
need for further business planning to determine best-outcome management of the
building/site into the future to ensure that community investment is maximised.

A broad concept document has been developed (but not yet endorsed) which seeks to
utilise the gaol as a centre for learning relating to heritage, trade skills, archaeology and
museum related fields – exploration of partnerships with the Centre for Heritage may act to
progress that concept.

                              supplementary interpretation and possible reinvigoration of
                              the baker’s oven. Such a use would link with the original use
                              of the building – i.e. provisioning the town.

     This archaeological significance was demonstrated by the 2012 summer archaeology program which
     located substantial (shallow and largely intact) remains of the 1827 barracks. The building has a very
     high level of community significance, having been the Oatlands State School within the living
     memory of many locals.

     The building comprises of four very large rooms, as well as foyers, large hallway, kitchenette and M&F
     toilets. There are also large upstairs spaces which have been blocked off in the 1930s. The building is

     offices for Rural Alive and Well.

     The front yard is used as landscaped public open space and the rear yard is parking. The Oatlands
     Military Precinct interpretation trail begins in front of the building and three interpretive platforms are
     installed on the site. Interpretation of the Oatlands Arch is to be installed on the former arch site (as a
     condition of works approval for the Oatlands Gaol Arch Relocation Project). The site is in a very
     strategic location for Council/public purposes, being in the centre of the town, a large space with
     good access. This was recognised in the Oatlands Integrated Development Strategy, which
     proposed the ‘Town Square’ principle, which would close Stutzer Street (between the Council
     Chambers and Roche Hall).

        Whilst SMC’s key focus over the next 5+ years will be the restoration and management of
        the Council owned buildings within the military precinct (as outlined below), some work on
        further understanding and interpreting the precinct will be undertaken as a means of
        contextualising the buildings within that precinct, and the precinct within the wider colonial
        administration. Mechanisms for the protection of the archaeological resources of the
        precinct are also a key consideration in the management of heritage values and work on
        understanding these values has been undertaken both by council and the Tasmanian
        Heritage Council. Much of the original precinct is still in government ownership.

     responding to works-driven archaeological needs, it is recognised that a comprehensive Southern
     Midlands Historical Archaeology Strategy is required in order to guide the future of the program
     through detailed research agendas, better understanding of resources and site significance and to
     set a more strategic direction for the program.

     Owned by Council, the small sandstone cottage on the southern shore of Lake Dulverton
     (distant from the township) has not been used for a number of years. Although the building is
     currently uninhabitable, basic maintenance is undertaken on the building under the
     management of the Lake Dulverton/Callington Park Committee, however restoration work is
     required if the building is to be used for any purpose.

     Suggestions have been previously made that this building be used in the interpretation of the
     natural values of Lake Dulverton or that it could be used as an adjunct to the current Artist in
     Residence program (through Arts Tasmania) which the Oatlands Gaolers Residence is used for.

                      Natural and cultural heritage



                      Bequeathed to the former Brighton Council by Mr. Anton
Previously endorsed   Chauncy (husband of writer Nan Chauncy, nee Masterman)
documents and         in 1988, and assumed by Southern Midlands Council after
                      1993 amalgamations, the Chauncy Vale Wildlife Sanctuary is
policy
                      a 380 hectare (plus other incorporated nature reserves,
                      public and private) reserve, just east of Bagdad. The house
<U+F0B7>   Chauncy Vale
    Management Plan   and home paddock of Chauncy Vale was later gifted to
                      Council by Anton’s daughter, Heather Chauncy. A sub-
                      committee of Council, the Chauncy Vale Management
                      Committee, manages the reserve under the gazetted
                      Chauncy Vale Management Plan.               Council has an
                      endorsed business plan for the reserve, and support is
                      provided by the Friends of Chauncy Vale Inc. The sanctuary
                      includes vast tracts of natural bush, several caves, as well as
                      the Day Dawn cottage, home of the Chauncy/Masterman
                      family from 1918 to 19881. Day Dawn Cottage is perhaps the
                      earliest example of formed concrete domestic architecture
                      in Tasmania. Section 1.2 of the management plan states
                      that one of the purposes of the plan is to:

                             a) provide for the conservation of the cultural and
                             natural environment of Chauncy Vale

                      Further, the states roles and responsibilities of Southern
                      Midlands Council in the management of Chauncy Vale
                      includes:

                                                                                        33

     Southern Midlands Council Historic Heritage Strategy 2014-2018




               b) restore and maintain the Chauncy house, insure the house and
               any material lent for display, and develop a heritage program
               through its Chauncy Vale Management Committee.
               c) undertake, through its Management Committee, heritage
               research, interpretation and education programs on its behalf subject
               both to adherence with the principles of the ICOMOS Burra Charter,
               as well as the input of a professional archaeologist where necessary.

        The wishes of Anton Chauncy, as endorsed by his daughter Heather, included that:

               c) the house, garden, and small garden, known as ‘the shrine’ be maintained
               together with a display of Nan Chauncy’s work in the house.

        The above purposes, responsibilities and wishes translate into the objectives of the
        management plan, which provide detail on the conservation, protection and promotion of
        the natural and cultural heritage values of Chauncy Vale. Of particular relevance to the
        Southern Midlands Historic Heritage Strategy 2009-14, is the conservation of the Day Dawn
        Cottage, the earlier Cherry Tree Cottage site, as well as the associated gardens and
        movable cultural heritage.

        In line with the management plan and the proposals contained therein (Section 4.4.2), and
        in consultation with the management committee and Friends of Chauncy Vale Inc (and
        other stakeholders). the following strategies should be pursued:

Council is the custodian of a collection of horse drawn carriages and associated equipment,
some of which is owned by council and some is on long-term loan from the family of a
benefactor who vested a collection into councils care. A purpose built faculty has been
constructed on the property adjoining the Kempton Recreation ground and a part of the
collection is stored and displayed in that building.


The horse drawn heritage initiative is being progressed by a sub-committee of the Green
Ponds Progress Association. A memorandum of understanding has been entered into with
that organisation which identifies a future development plan for the property within which
the facility is constructed. The equipment is used occasionally for special events and there
are plan to eventually open the facility for public visitation.


Council’s heritage collection holds other items which are of relevance to horse drawn
heritage and it is intended that these will be incorporated into that initiative in the future.

                                        careful evolution of townscape character is needed to

Important partnerships have been established between council and authorities such as
Aurora energy so that careful consideration is given to minimising (and indeed undoing) the
heritage impact that utility lines (for instance) can have on streetscape values.

In the mid-1990s, a tourism study lamented that the landscape of the midlands was ‘one of
the most uninteresting in Tasmania’. This notion was countered in the 2007 Southern
Midlands Heritage Project, which articulated the significant evidence of thousands of years
of human occupation evident in the cultural landscape of the Southern Midlands and the
cultural heritage values inherent in such. This illustrates a growing appreciation of the
landscape values of the Southern Midlands.

With the proposed amendments and additions to heritage precincts proposed in the draft
planning scheme, coupled with associated guiding documents and character statements,
a greater appreciation and ability to manage the streetscape and landscape values of the
Southern Midlands is being built.

Partnerships with Arts Tasmania have been beneficial in the development of these processes. An
archaeological artifact processing laboratory has been established in the Oatlands Gaolers
Residence. A long-term project of populating the databases as well as ongoing audit of
collection storage and dispkay facilities is ongoing.

Further to collection management policies, arises the requirement for display and storage
facilities. A preservation survey was undertaken on the Oatlands Gaol and Court House
collections, which also examined several Council managed properties for their suitability in
housing the collection. Arising from this report, a discussion paper on the suitability of several
Council managed properties was more closely examined, incorporating conservation principles
as well as resourcing and management constraints. This paper concluded that the front-western
room of the Oatlands Supreme Court House should be fitted as a publicly interpreted collection
store as a short-medium term measure, with Council to pursue acquisition of a State owned
Police building for development as a longer-term facility. As an alternative to the court house, an
upstairs room at the Oatlands Gaolers Residence has been fitted as a ‘temporary’ collection
store, which is not ideal. A high priority is to establish an industry standard collection store which
may also have commercial possibilities to offer services to external clients.

      A major step in engaging the public in heritage education is the 2010 establishment of the
      Centre for Heritage at Oatlands – Heritage Education and Skills Centre (HESC), which is a not-
      for-profit community focused heritage skills training organisation owned by Council. HESC
      develops and delivers a series of heritage short-courses in subjects from heritage interpretation,
      trade skills, archaeology and museum skills. HESC also aligns heritage skills training with tourism
      and has also forged alliances with several local schools and universities Australia-wide to
      facilitate student projects (the annual summer archaeology program is an example of this).
      Council is a key partner in all of these initiatives and continues to support HESC and initiatives
      on local projects and sites are a priority.

      Council recognises the need to include the community in all aspects of heritage management
      and public consultation and participation is encourage in the planning and implementation of
      heritage projects.

                                        essential that with any heritage projects in which Council

and interpretation of these sites is required. It is recognised that an unplanned and ad-hoc
approach to heritage place interpretation is rarely beneficial, and that careful planning is required

Review of the strategy & reporting
It is intended that the Southern Midlands Council Historic
Heritage Strategy be reviewed should any circumstance
result in any major changes to the heritage program of the
framework in which it operates.
It is acknowledged that a review of the strategy will be
required once the new Southern Midlands Planning Scheme
is in-place.
This strategy will be made freely available via council’s
website.


An annual report on the achievements against this strategy is
to be provided to council and any interested stakeholders
(and published on council’s website).
