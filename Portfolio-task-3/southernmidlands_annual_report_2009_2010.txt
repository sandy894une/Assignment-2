Introduction
| The Year in Review — Mayor Anthony E Bisdee
It is my pleasure to present this Annual Report for the 2009/2010 period.
The past year has provided some challenges for the Southern Midlands
Council but | believe we have managed these challenges in a responsible and
efficient manner.
Reconstruction of the Callington Flour Mill at Oatlands has certainly been
Council’s major project. A fully operational wind-powered flour mill has been a
vision of the community for many years, and | am most pleased to report that
this vision will become a reality. The Millwright and all the internal machinery
components arrived in early May from the UK, and by the end of the financial
year substantial reconstruction work had commenced.
We have been extremely fortunate with the continued community support for
the project, and the craftsmanship and professionalism of both Council staff
and local sub contractors who have taken personal pride in this iconic project.
We all look forward to the completion of the Mill and the new Visitor Centre.
On a much less positive issue, the heavy rains experienced in August created
much havoc and caused damage to Council roads (both sealed and un-
sealed). Regrettably, two bridges over the Jordan River in the Elderslie area
(Jones Road and Andersons Road) were substantially damaged which
required the need to provide temporary crossings. In relation to the Anderson
Road bridge, it was necessary for Council to hire a Bailey Bridge from the
Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources to guarantee access to
properties whilst engineering assessment and reconstruction works are
undertaken. Total cost to Council as a result of these losses will exceed
$300,000.
Despite the damage, the heavy rains were very welcome after such a long
(perhaps ten years) period of drought. It was so refreshing to see all the rivers
and creeks running again, and farm dams full. An overflowing Craigbourne
Dam was a wonderful sight and a very reassuring prospect for the irrigators in
the Coal River Valley for the next summer period.
The Southern Midlands Council was very fortunate to receive a considerable
amount of funding from the Australian Government under both Rounds 1 and
2 of the ‘Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program (RLCIP). This
program was introduced as part of an overall federal stimulus package.

Introduction
The Year in Review — Mayor Anthony E Bisdee OAM
Important projects undertaken were: building extension - Community Centre at
Oatlands; upgrade of the Kempton Watch house; Horse-drawn Heritage
Coach house & Stables at Kempton; establishment of the Melton Mowbray
Roadside Park; extension of the change rooms at the Kempton Recreation
Ground; upgrading of the Mangalore Recreation Ground Pony Club facilities;
construction of new internal toilets at the Campania Recreation Ground;
construction of new public toilets adjacent to the Colebrook History Room;
upgrade of Flour Mill Park at Campania; building improvements at the
Woodsdale Recreation Ground; installation of an underground watering
system at the Oatlands Recreation Ground; and purchase of a Mobile Skate
Park.
During 2009-10, Council also participated in the Southern Tasmania Regional
Planning Project. A key outcome of this project will be the development of a
new Planning Scheme for the Southern Midlands Council which will be
consistent with the overall regional strategy and other Schemes to be
prepared by the individual Councils. Much work has been undertaken by the
consultants towards progressing this Regional Planning Project, which has
included considerable consultation with the community, Council planning
officers and councillors.
In relation to the new Planning Scheme, there are changes proposed for the
heritage precincts of Campania, Colebrook, Kempton and Oatlands; as well
as identifying and rezoning some areas to better reflect proposed settlement
patterns — especially in the Bagdad and Mangalore Valley areas.
This very important Regional Planning Project has still a considerable way to
go before we will see a new planning scheme for the Southern Midlands.
Further community consultation will take place during the development
process before adoption of the draft schemes and submission to the
Tasmanian Planning Authority. | strongly believe that initiatives proposed in
the draft scheme will enhance and promote sustainable development within
the Southern Midlands municipal area; strengthen the provisions to protect
our heritage buildings; and provide clearer guidelines for developers.
Water & Sewerage Reform - Council continues to monitor (as far as possible)
the provision of quality water and sewerage services. Whilst much adverse
publicity has followed the establishment and operation of the new Water &
Sewerage Corporations, mainly in regard to the excessive price increases, the
service provided by Southern Water to consumers remains at a reasonably
satisfactory level. | believe that a parliamentary enquiry to review the
operations and effectiveness of the new Corporations is planned for 2011. It is
anticipated that the Southern Midlands Council will make a submission to
raise any issues that are evident at that time.

Introduction
The Year in Review — Mayor Anthony E Bisdee OAM
Responsible financial management remains a high priority for Council, and we
continue to implement our financial strategy and associated policies,
particularly as it relates to funding of depreciation. The Auditor-General has
been critical of Tasmanian councils who do not fully fund infrastructure
depreciation and we must address this issue to be sustainable into the future.
The successful operation of the Southern Midlands council during the past
year can be attributed to the professionalism and dedication of the General
Manager, Mr Tim Kirkwood and all staff and | thank each and everyone for
their positive contributions.
As we look forward to another year of challenges and issues to resolve, |
remain confident that within our finite resources we will continue to provide
good local governance to all our constituents.
As the festive season nears, on behalf of my wife Sue, fellow Councillors and
staff, | wish to extend to everyone a very happy and safe Christmas and
prosperous New Year.

Heritage (Continued) In 2007 Southern Midlands Council, Heritage
Tasmania and Tourism Tasmania completed a
joint project which provided recommendations to
update the State and local heritage registers,
subsequently identify and describe cultural
landscapes and then determine how knowledge
of cultural landscapes and heritage assets can
be used to advance sustainable tourism.
Southern Midlands and Heritage Tasmania are
now working together to implement the
recommendations of the report in regard to the
listing of heritage places. It regard to heritage
precincts, it is envisaged that the next Southern
Midlands planning scheme will include enlarged
heritage precincts at Oatlands, Kempton,
Campania and Mangalore, and a new precinct
at Colebrook.

The architect Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin,
(1812-1852), is recognized as Britain’s greatest
early-Victonan designer. St Paul’s Catholic
Church in Oatlands and St Patrick’s in
Colebrook are two of only a handful of his
buildings in Australia and are very much in
original condition. Southern Midlands Council is
working to support the Pugin Foundation to help
preserve both the Oatlands and Colebrook
churches and to develop a “Pugin Trail’ running
from Oatlands through Colebrook and Richmond
to Hobart.

The Responsibility of the General Manager for the Financial Statements
ia The General Manager is responsible for the preparation and _ fair
presentation of the financial statements in accordance with Australian
| Accounting Standards (including Australian Accounting Interpretations)
and Section 84 of the Loca/ Government Act 1993. This responsibility
includes establishing and maintaining internal controls relevant to the
| preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and
applying appropriate accounting policies: and making accounting
Ig estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility
if My responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements
based upon my audit. My audit was conducted in accordance with
it Australian Auditing Standards. These Auditing Standards require that I
comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance as to
il whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. °
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about
il the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
it fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers
| internal control relevant to Council‘s preparation and fair presentation of
the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
i appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of Council’s internal control. An audit also

 iu Manager, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
T statements.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and
1 appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
My audit is not designed to provide assurance on the accuracy and
appropriateness of the budget information in Council’s financial
fF statements.
Independence
i In conducting this audit, I have complied with the independence
requirements of Australian Auditing Standards and other reievant ethical!
il requirements. The Audit Act 2008 further promotes independence by:
: © providing that only Parliament, and not the executive government,
B! can remove an Auditor-General, and
© mandating the Auditor-General as auditor of State Entities but
; preciuding the provision of non-audit services, thus ensuring the
il Auditor-General and the Tasmanian Audit Office are not
| compromised in their role by the possibility of losing clients or
b income.
al Auditor’s Opinion
| In my opinion the financial statements of Southern Midlands Council:
(a) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
| Council as at 30 June 2010, and of its financial performance,
cash flows and changes in equity for the year then ended; and
| (b) are in accordance with the Loca/ Government Act 1993 and
Australian Accounting Standards (including Australian
Accounting Interpretations).

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

a) Basis of Accounting
This general purpose financial report has been prepared on an accruals basis in
accordance with the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial
Statements, Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements
of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB). It is presented in Australian
dollars.
Except for certain assets, including infrastructure assets, which are valued at fair value
in accordance with AASB 116 as disclosed in the relevant notes, the report has been
prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Australian Accounting Standards include Australian equivalents to International
Financial Reporting Standards (AIFRSs). Some AIFRSs contain requirements specific
to not-for-profit entities that are inconsistent with IFRS requirements. Except to the
extent that these special provisions require, this financial report complies with AIFRSs.
In the application of accounting standards and other authoritative pronouncements of
the AASB, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience
and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis of making the judgements. Actual results may differ
from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions
to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if
the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods
if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Accounting policies are selected and applied in a manner which ensures that the
resulting financial information satisfies the concepts of relevance and reliability,
thereby ensuring that the substance of the underlying transactions or other events is
reported.

b) The Local Government Reporting Entity
All funds through which the Council controls resources to carry on its functions have
been included in the Financial Statements forming part of this Financial Report.
In the process of reporting on the Council as a single unit, all transactions and balances
between those funds (for example, loans and transfers between funds) have been
eliminated in full.
Amounts, 1f any, received as tender deposits and retention amounts controlled by
Council are included in the amount disclosed as "other payables" within current
liabilities.

c) Acquisitions of Assets
The cost method of accounting is used for the initial recording of all acquisitions of
assets. Cost is determined as the fair value of the assets given up at the date of
acquisition plus costs incidental to the acquisition. Architects’ fees and engineering
design fees are included in the costs of assets acquired.
Fair value means the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between a
knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arm's length
transaction.

d) Valuations of Non-Current Assets
Council has adopted the following valuation bases for its non-current assets:
Land — Fair value
Buildings — Fair value
Plant, machinery & equipment — Cost
Minor plant — Cost
Office furniture & equipment — Cost
Water, sewerage and stormwater — Fair value
Bridges — Fair value
Roads — Fair value
Waste management — Cost
Heritage — Cost
Intangibles — Cost
Asset classes, excluding land, are measured on the fair value basis and are revalued to
their “current cost” less accumulated depreciation. Acquisitions and capital works
during the year are treated as being recorded at their fair value.

e) Impairment of Assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested
annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised equal to the amount
by which an asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For non-
cash generating assets such as roads and public buildings value in use is represented by
the deprival value of the asset approximated by it’s written down replacement cost.

f) Depreciation of Non-Current Assets
All non-current assets having a limited useful life are systematically depreciated over
their useful lives in a manner that reflects the consumption of the service potential
embodied in those assets. Land is not a depreciable asset.
Heritage assets have not been depreciated. This is based on advice given to Council
that provided adequate care and attention is regularly given to these assets, the value of
the assets remains constant.
Depreciation 1s recognised on a straight-line basis, using rates, which are reviewed
each reporting period. Assets acquired since valuation are depreciated at rates based on
their estimated useful lives commencing from the beginning of the month after which
the asset first became available for use.
Main depreciation periods are:
Buildings 10 to 50 years
Plant, machinery & equipment 4 to 15 years
Motor vehicles 0 to 2 years
Office furniture & equipment 5 to 25 years
Computers > years
Infrastructure 33 to 60 years
Furniture > to 100 years
Water systems 25 to 100 years
Sewerage systems 20 to 60 years
Stormwater/drainage systems 40 to 60 years
Roads 10 to 100 years
Bridges & culverts 15 to 100 years

g) Recognition of Purchased Assets
Items will not be recognised as assets but treated as expenses if their purchase or
construction cost does not reach certain limits. These limits vary according to the asset
classification as follows:
$
Land Nil
Plant, machinery & equipment 1,000
Furniture & fittings 500
Office equipment 250
Buildings 5,000
Roads Nil
Water 3,000
Bridges 5,000
Sewerage 3,000
Storm water/drainage 3,000
Recreation Facilities/community amenities 2,000
Heritage Assets Nil
h) Stores and materials
Stores and materials are carried at the lower of cost and net replacement value. Assets
are taken into stores at cost and issued at weighted average cost assuming items first
purchased are first consumed.
i) Employee Entitlements
The bases of measurement of liabilities for each type of employee entitlement are as
follows:
Wages and Salaries and Annual Leave
Liabilities for employee entitlements to wages and salaries, annual leave and other
current employee entitlements are accrued at nominal amounts calculated on the basis
of expected wage and salary rates at the time of payment.
Sick Leave
Council’s Enterprise Bargaining Agreement provides for employees who resign from
their position with Council to be paid a percentage of their sick leave balance based on
completed years of service, plus a gratuity amount.
The above statement should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes

COUNCIL = SS Page 10

NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE ACCOUNTS

30 June 2010
Long Service Leave
Liabilities for employee entitlements, which are not expected to be settled within 12
months of balance date, are accrued as the present value of expected future payments to
be made in respect of services provided by employees up to balance date.
Consideration is given, when assessing future payments, to expected future wage and
salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Related
oncosts (superannuation, workers compensation and payroll tax) are included in the
calculation of the provision for long service leave. Expected future payments are
discounted using the appropriate indicative rates on selected Commonwealth
Government Securities.
The current lability represents the amount due to employees with at least nine
completed years of service. The remainder is shown as a non-current liability.
Superannuation
The superannuation expense for the reporting period is the amount of the statutory
contribution the Council makes to the superannuation plans that provide benefits to its
employees. Details of these arrangements are set out in note 28.

}) Leases
The Council currently has no material finance or operating lease arrangements.

k) Revenue Recognition
Rates, Grants, Donations and Other Contributions
Rates, grants, donations and other contributions are recognised as revenues when the
Council obtains control over the assets comprising the contributions. Control over
assets acquired from rates is obtained at the commencement of the rating period or,
where earlier, upon receipt of the rates. Control over granted assets is normally
obtained upon their receipt or upon prior notification that a grant has been secured, and
the timing of commencement of control depends upon the arrangements that exist
between the grantor and the Council.
Unreceived contributions over which the Council has control are recognised as
receivables. In respect of unpaid rates, an allowance for impairment is made for
amounts considered uncollectible.
No contributions were received during the reporting period that were obtained on the
condition that they be expended in a particular manner or used over a particular period.
User charges and fees
User charges and fees are recognised as revenue when the service has been provided,
the payment is received, or when the penalty has been applied, whichever first occurs.
A provision for impairment is recognised when collection in full is no longer probable.
Sale of plant, property, infrastructure and equipment
The profit or loss on sale of an asset is determined when control of the asset has
irrevocably passed to the buyer.
Interest and rents
Interest and rents are recognised as revenue on a proportional basis when the payment
is due, the value of the payment is notified, or the payment is received, whichever first
occurs.
Dividend Revenue
Dividend revenue is recognised when Council's right to receive payment is established.

]) Financial Assets and Liabilities
Financial Assets
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits at call with financial
institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are
subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Cash equivalents are held for the
purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other
purposes.
Cash on hand and at bank and term deposits are valued at face value.
Rate debtors
Rates are carried at nominal amounts due plus interest which are assumed to equal their
fair values. Rate debts are a charge attached to the property and are recoverable on sale,
therefore, no allowance for impairment is made.
Significant Terms and Conditions - Rates are payable by four instalments during the
year or alternatively by one payment within thirty days of the date of issue (which
provides for a discount of 1.1%). Arrears, including deferred rates, attract interest. The
interest rate was 9.5% (9.5% in 2008/2009) at balance date for general rates.
Should amounts remain unpaid outside of approved payment options, Council will
instigate collection proceedings.
Other debtors
Receivables are carried at nominal amounts due less any allowance for impairment. An
impairment loss is recognised when collection in full is no longer probable.
Collectibility of overdue accounts is assessed on an ongoing basis.
Significant Terms and Conditions - Payment is required within thirty days of issue of
the account. No interest is attracted to other debtors. Should amounts remain unpaid
outside of approved payment options, Council will instigate collection proceedings.

Financial liabilities
Trade and other payables
Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods and services
provided to Council as at balance date. The nominal value less estimated credit
adjustments of trade and other payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
Significant terms and conditions - General creditors are unsecured, not subject to
interest charges and are normally settled within specified trading terms or 30 days
whichever is the earlier.
Interest bearing loans & liabilities
Loans are carried at their principal amounts, which represent the present value of future
cash flows associated with servicing the debt. Interest is accrued.
Significant terms and conditions - The debenture loans of Council are secured by trust
deed. In accordance with Section 80 of the Local Government Act 1993, the borrowing
capacity of Council is limited to:

e -Except with the approval of the Minister, a council may not borrow
additional money for any purpose if the annual payments required to
service the total borrowings would exceed 30% of its revenue of the
preceding financial year.

e Grants made to a council for specific purposes are to be excluded in
calculating 30% of revenue of the council.

m) Comparative Information
Where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in
presentation in the current year.

n) Valuation - Land under Roads
In accordance with AASB 1051, Council has elected not to recognise land under roads
acquired prior to 1 July 2008. From 1 July 2008 any land under roads is recognised in
accordance with AASB116; that is it is not generally recognised until it satisfies both
recognition criteria of providing economic benefits and having a reliably measured
cost. As such land is generally acquired for no or nominal consideration. When it is
recognised its cost is its fair value.

0) Investments in Water Corporations
Investments in water corporations are valued at fair value; at balance date. Fair value is
determined by using the ownership percentage against the water corporations’ net asset
value at balance date. Any unrealised gains and loses on holdings at balance date are
recognised in the Comprehensive Income Statement.
Pp) Goods and Services Tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services
tax (GST), except:

i. where the amount of the GST incurred is not recoverable from the taxation
authority, it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of an asset or as
part of an item of expense; or

il. for receivables and payables which are recognised inclusive of GST.

The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is
included as part of receivables or payables.
Cash flows are presented in the cash flow statement on a gross basis, except for the
GST component of investing and financing activities, which are disclosed as operating
cash flows.

q) Statement of Comprehensive Income — Budget Amounts
The Budget amounts which appear in the Comprehensive income statement are taken
from the Annual Estimates and are not subject to audit.

7. INVESTMENT IN SOUTHERN (HOBART) WATER
In February of 2008 State and Local Government reached agreement to establish
three, Local Government owned, vertically integrated businesses providing bulk,
distribution and retail water and sewerage services, and a common service
provider subsidiary company. The Water and Sewerage Corporations Act 2008
(Corporations Act) was subsequently enacted and received Royal Assent on 13
June 2008.
Full transfer of water and sewerage assets, liabilities and staff to the new
corporations took place on 1 July 2009. From that date, responsibility for the
provision of water and sewerage services moved from local councils to three
new regional water and sewerage corporations (trading as Cradle Mountain
Water, Ben Lomond Water and Southern Water). A fourth company provides
common services and support to the three regional corporations.
Southern Midlands Council’s ownership interest in the Hobart Regional Water
Authority, trading as Hobart Water, was transferred to Southern Water from
I July 2009. The following assets and liabilities relating to water and sewerage
were transferred to Southern Water. Council’s opening ownership interest in the
new corporation is represented by the net assets transferred.

At 30 June 2010, Council has an ownership interest of 1.2% (based on the 2009
Draft Treasurer’s Returns Allocation Order) in Southern Water. At the time of
preparation of this report the Treasurer was yet to finalise the Order. Council
does not have significant influence to allow it to use the equity method to
account for this interest.
It has classified this asset as an Available-for-Sale financial asset as defined in
AAB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and has
followed AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation and AASB 7 Financial
Instruments: Disclosures to value and present the asset in the financial
statements.
There is no active market for the investment and so it is valued at Council’s
share of total equity as at each balance date. Changes in the fair value are
recognised as revenue or expense in the Comprehensive Income Statement each
year. Council’s investment is disclosed on the face of the Balance Sheet with the
value being determined as disclosed above. Dividends received from Southern
Water are brought to account as income is received.
Council's share of the Corporation’s net assets at 30 June 2010 is
$10.989 million.

28. SUPERANNUATION
The Southern Midlands Council makes superannuation contributions for a number of
its employees to the Quadrant Defined Benefits Fund, which is a sub fund of the
Quadrant Superannuation Scheme. The Quadrant Defined Benefits Fund has been
classified as a multi-employer sponsored plan. As the Fund’s assets and liabilities are
pooled and are not allocated by employer, the Actuary is unable to allocate benefit
liabilities, assets and costs between employers. As provided under paragraph 32(b) of
AASB 119, Council does not use defined benefit accounting for these contributions.
At the present time Council contributes 9.5% of employees’ gross income to the Fund.
Assets accumulate in the fund to meet member benefits as they accrue, and if assets
within the fund are insufficient to satisfy benefits payable, the Council is required to
meet its share of the deficiency.
Bendzulla Actuarial Pty Ltd undertook the last actuarial review of the Fund at 30 June
2008. The review disclosed that at that time the net market value of assets available
for funding member benefits was $84,786,241, the value of vested benefits was
$77,075,401, the surplus was $7,707,840, and the value of total accrued benefits was
$81,398,000. These amounts relate to all members of the fund at the date of valuation
and no asset or liability is recorded in the Quadrant Superannuation Scheme’s
financial statements for Council employees.
The financial assumptions used to calculate the Accrued Benefits for the Fund were:
Net Investment Return -17.0% p.a. for 2008/09 and 7.0% p.a. thereafter
Salary Inflation 4.0% pa
Price Inflation n/a
In the opinion of the Actuary, the Quadrant Defined Benefit Fund was adequately
funded in that assets were sufficient to cover the vested benefits of all members at the
review date and the actuarial value of accrued past service benefits.
At 30 June 2009, the net market value of assets available for funding member benefits
had fallen to $58,450,000 largely due to the poor investment returns that were
experienced during the 2009 financial year. The value of vested benefits at that date
was $64,350,000 resulting in a shortfall of $5,900,000. When the Fund’s assets are
below the vested benefits, superannuation law defines this as an “unsatisfactory
financial position”. As a result of the Fund moving into an unsatisfactory financial
position, the Quadrant Trustee prepared a plan to restore the financial position within
a reasonable time frame. This plan noted the improved investment returns since 30
June 2009 and confirmed that the 9.5% contribution rare remained appropriate.

28. SUPERANNUATION (CONTINUED)
The next full triennial review will be undertaken after 31 October 2011 for 30 June
2011.
Council also contributes to other accumulation schemes on behalf of a number of
employees, however the Council has no ongoing responsibility to make good any
deficiencies that may occur in those schemes.
During the year Council made the required superannuation contributions for all
eligible employees to an appropriate complying superannuation fund as required by
the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992.
During the reporting period the amount of contributions paid to defined benefits
schemes was $218,458 (2008-09 $233,905), and the amount paid to accumulation
schemes was $49,448 (2008-09, $45,266).

31. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
a) Risk Exposures and Mitigation
The risks associated with our main financial instruments and our policies for
minimising these risks are detailed below.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument
will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types
of risk, those being currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk. Council's
exposure to or management of these risks has not changed since the previous period.
Components of market risk to which we are exposed are discussed below.
Currency Risk:
This is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Council has established a
Foreign Currency Account through the Commonwealth Bank and invested sufficient
funds in Great British Pounds to meet the remaining payments under the Contract with
Traditional Millwrights Ltd relating to the Callington Mill. There is no market risk of
fluctuation as the Contract is also in Great British Pounds.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument, or cash
flows associated with the instrument, will fluctuate due to changes in market interest
rates. Interest rate risk arises from interest bearing financial assets and liabilities that
we use. Non derivative interest bearing assets are predominantly short term liquid
assets. Our interest rate liability risk arises primarily from long term loans and
borrowings at fixed rates which exposes us to fair value interest rate risk.
We manage interest rate risk on our net debt portfolio by:

. ensuring access to diverse sources of funding;

. reducing risks of refinancing by managing in accordance with target maturity

profiles; and

. setting prudential limits on interest repayments as a percentage of rate revenue.
We manage the interest rate exposure on our debt portfolio by appropriate budgeting
strategies and obtaining approval for borrowings from the Department of Treasury and
Finance each year.

a) Risk Exposures and Mitigation (continued)
Investment of surplus funds is made with approved financial institutions under the
Local Government Act 1993. We manage interest rate risk by adopting an investment
policy that ensures:

. conformity with State and Federal regulations and standards,

. capital protection,

. appropriate liquidity,

. diversification by credit rating, financial institution and investment product,

. monitoring of return on investment,

. benchmarking of returns and comparison with budget.
Other Price Risk:
This is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest
rate risk or currency risk, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the
individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial
instruments traded in the market. Council is not aware of having any exposure to this
risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a contracting entity will not complete its obligations under a
financial instrument and cause Council to make a financial loss. Council have
exposure to credit risk on some financial assets included in our balance sheet. To help
manage this risk:

. we have a policy for establishing credit limits for the entities we deal with;

. Wwe may require collateral where appropriate; and

. we only invest surplus funds with financial institutions which have a

recognised credit rating.

Credit risk arises from Council's financial assets, which comprise cash and cash
equivalents, and trade and other receivables. Council's exposure to credit risk arises
from potential default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the
carrying amount of these instruments. Exposure at balance date is addressed in each
applicable note.
Council generally trades with recognised, creditworthy third parties, and as such
collateral is generally not requested, nor is it Council's policy to securitise its trade and
other receivables. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis
with the result that Council's exposure to bad debts is not significant.

30 June 2010
a) Risk Exposures and Mitigation (continued)
Amounts owing in relation to rates are secured by a charge over the land to which the
debts relate. Debtors other than rate debtors have not been written off or written down
during the reporting period.
Council generally diversifies its investments and restricts investments to entities with
Standard and Poor’s long term credit ratings of BBB+ or better, or short term credit
ratings of A.1 or better.
There has been no change in Council’s exposure to or management of this risk since
the previous period.
Ageing of Trade and Other Receivables
The following table provides an ageing of Council’s trade and rate receivables at the
reporting date:
30 June 2010 30 June 2009

Total trade receivables 247 - 403 -
Water Meter Debtors 7 - 89 :
Rates receivable 325 - 315 -
Total receivables $579 = § - $807 =§
Ageing of individually impaired Trade and Other Receivables
A provision for impairment loss is recognised when there is objective evidence that an
individual receivable is impaired. No allowance for impairment in respect of rate and
trade receivables has been recognised at 30 June 2010. Some of the long outstanding
past due amounts have been lodged with Council's debt collectors or are on payment
arrangements.

a) Risk Exposures and Mitigation (continued)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk includes the risk that, as a result of our operational liquidity
requirements:
. Wwe will not have sufficient funds to settle a transaction on the date;
. we will be forced to sell financial assets at a value which is less than what they
are worth; or
. Wwemay be unable to settle or recover a financial asset at all.
To help reduce these risks we:
. have readily accessible standby facilities and other funding arrangements in
place;
. monitor budget to actual performance on a regular basis; and
. set limits on borrowings relating to the percentage of loans to rate revenue and
percentage of loan principal repayments to rate revenue.
The Council’s exposure to liquidity risk is deemed insignificant based on prior
periods' data and current assessment of risk.
A maturity analysis is included in part b) of this note. It's exposure to or management
of this risk has not changed since the previous period.
