# Mapping the Data

## Heritage Places

Information on places listed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register are available at <https://www.thelist.tas.gov.au/> and can be exported using the 'Export' feature under 'Tools'.

The exported data is emailed, and the files can then be unzipped into the QGIS project folder, and added to a layer of the map. The file added in this case was HeritageRegister.shp.

By filtering the attribute table to records with a location of Kempton, adding labels with a call out, and moving the labels for better readability, the image shown in Figure 1 was created and exported as a Print Layer. A clickable version of this map was also created and exported using the QGIS2WEB plugin.[^1]

## Georeferencing a Map

A QGIS tutorial on georeferencing was used to overlay a town chart from the Tasmanian State Library showing land grants in Green Ponds / Kempton.[^2]

[^2]: [@georefera][@libraried]

Through a series of trial and error attempts to match the chart to the QGIS OpenStreetMap base map, the following settings gave the best results:

-   Transformation Type : Projective

-   Target SRS : EPSG:3857 - WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator

-   Selected CRS (the button next to Target SRS) : Unknown datum based upon the Australian National Spheroid

Once the Georeferencing was complete, the transparency of the overlay was set to 30% to allow both the overlay and the underlying base map to be visible. The resulting Print Layout image is shown in Figure 2.
